00:01:13:46 - 00:01:14:06
And

00:01:14:06 - 00:01:14:18
since

00:01:14:18 - 00:01:14:24
I

00:01:14:24 - 00:01:14:38
started

00:01:14:38 - 00:01:14:54
actually

00:01:14:54 - 00:01:15:07
using

00:01:15:07 - 00:01:15:30
the chair

00:01:15:30 - 00:01:16:17

Eureka

00:01:16:46 - 00:01:17:00
sent it

00:01:17:00 - 00:01:17:40
to me,

00:01:17:40 - 00:01:18:07
my skin

00:01:18:07 - 00:01:18:37

00:01:18:37 - 00:01:19:13
legitimately

00:01:19:13 - 00:01:19:35
cleared

00:01:19:35 - 00:01:19:48

my skin

00:01:30:25 - 00:01:30:46
completely

00:01:30:46 - 00:01:30:59
cleared

00:01:30:59 - 00:01:31:30

00:01:31:30 - 00:01:31:53
everything

00:01:31:53 - 00:01:32:02

00:01:38:04 - 00:01:38:18

nothing

00:02:31:57 - 00:02:32:13
yet.

00:02:32:13 - 00:02:32:22
I

00:02:32:22 - 00:02:32:47
mean,

00:02:32:47 - 00:02:33:03
Golden

00:02:33:03 - 00:02:33:25
Guardians

00:02:33:25 - 00:02:34:04
are ahead

00:02:34:04 - 00:02:34:22
because

00:02:34:22 - 00:02:34:42
they're

00:02:34:42 - 00:02:34:58
there.

00:02:34:58 - 00:02:35:11
They're

00:02:35:58 - 00:02:36:45
the opponents.

00:02:36:45 - 00:02:36:55
So

00:02:36:55 - 00:02:37:08
that's

00:02:37:08 - 00:02:37:22
really

00:02:37:22 - 00:02:37:51
good.

00:02:37:57 - 00:02:38:24
They're theme

00:02:38:24 - 00:02:38:45
answering

00:02:38:45 - 00:02:38:51
and

00:02:38:51 - 00:02:39:07
they have

00:02:39:07 - 00:02:39:34
superior

00:02:39:34 - 00:02:40:17
scaling.

00:02:40:17 - 00:02:40:26
So

00:02:40:26 - 00:02:40:39
Golden

00:02:40:39 - 00:02:41:00
Guardians

00:02:41:00 - 00:02:41:04

00:02:42:09 - 00:02:42:21
That

00:02:42:21 - 00:02:42:34
doesn't

00:02:42:34 - 00:02:42:57
matter.

00:02:42:57 - 00:02:43:15
And

00:02:43:16 - 00:02:43:22
they

00:02:43:22 - 00:02:43:40
finally

00:02:43:40 - 00:02:43:53
lose

00:02:43:53 - 00:02:44:22

00:02:44:22 - 00:02:44:34
That's

00:02:44:34 - 00:02:44:51
that's

00:02:44:51 - 00:02:45:10
true.

00:02:45:10 - 00:02:45:27
Yeah.

00:02:45:27 - 00:02:45:37

00:02:45:37 - 00:02:45:48
it's

00:03:01:26 - 00:03:01:40
would be

00:03:01:40 - 00:03:01:51
good

00:03:01:51 - 00:03:02:00
here

00:03:02:00 - 00:03:02:07
for

00:03:02:07 - 00:03:02:20
Golden

00:03:02:20 - 00:03:02:47
Guardians.

00:03:02:47 - 00:03:03:05
Now

00:03:04:10 - 00:03:04:33
Brown

00:03:04:33 - 00:03:04:42
would

00:03:04:42 - 00:03:04:51
be

00:03:04:51 - 00:03:05:11
better

00:03:05:11 - 00:03:05:22
than

00:03:05:22 - 00:03:05:34
this

00:03:05:34 - 00:03:05:58
glass.

00:03:05:58 - 00:03:06:37
Yeah,

00:03:06:45 - 00:03:06:55
but

00:03:06:55 - 00:03:07:04
they

00:03:07:04 - 00:03:07:21
pissed.

00:03:07:21 - 00:03:07:33
They

00:03:07:33 - 00:03:07:46
pick

00:03:07:46 - 00:03:08:00
Miss

00:03:08:00 - 00:03:08:22
Glass

00:03:08:22 - 00:03:08:31
for

00:03:08:31 - 00:03:08:49
laning

00:03:08:49 - 00:03:09:07
phase.

00:03:09:07 - 00:03:09:46
I think

00:03:09:46 - 00:03:09:57
so.

00:03:09:57 - 00:03:10:08
I do

00:03:10:08 - 00:03:10:17
think

00:03:10:17 - 00:03:10:28
that

00:03:10:28 - 00:03:10:46
LG are

00:03:10:46 - 00:03:10:57
going to

00:03:10:57 - 00:03:11:29
win,

00:03:11:51 - 00:03:12:18
but

00:03:12:18 - 00:03:12:59
I do think

00:03:12:59 - 00:03:13:04
that

00:03:13:04 - 00:03:13:21
Golden

00:03:13:21 - 00:03:13:42
Guardians

00:03:13:42 - 00:03:14:02
have a

00:03:14:02 - 00:03:14:42
vastly

00:03:14:42 - 00:03:15:09
superior

00:03:15:09 - 00:03:15:52
draft.

00:03:15:52 - 00:03:16:10
I think

00:03:16:10 - 00:03:16:24
this is

00:03:16:24 - 00:03:17:15
a very

00:03:17:15 - 00:03:17:52
disgusting

00:03:17:52 - 00:03:18:07
draft

00:03:18:07 - 00:03:18:37
advantage.

00:03:18:37 - 00:03:18:57
I like

00:03:18:57 - 00:03:19:08
seeing

00:03:19:08 - 00:03:19:30
the scorch

00:03:19:30 - 00:03:19:37
on

00:03:19:37 - 00:03:19:58
Malfoy

00:03:19:58 - 00:03:20:16
yet

00:03:20:49 - 00:03:21:21
Malfoy

00:03:21:21 - 00:03:21:32
is

00:03:21:32 - 00:03:22:01
a champion

00:03:22:01 - 00:03:22:06
that

00:03:22:06 - 00:03:22:17
doesn't

00:03:22:17 - 00:03:22:31
actually

00:03:22:31 - 00:03:22:49
benefit

00:03:22:49 - 00:03:22:57
that

00:03:22:57 - 00:03:23:04
much

00:03:23:04 - 00:03:23:13
from

00:03:23:13 - 00:03:23:33
gathering

00:03:23:33 - 00:03:23:52
storm

00:03:23:52 - 00:03:24:03
because

00:03:24:03 - 00:03:24:12
he's

00:03:24:12 - 00:03:24:34
mostly

00:03:24:34 - 00:03:24:50
single

00:03:24:50 - 00:03:25:44
target

00:03:26:18 - 00:03:27:59
and

00:03:27:59 - 00:03:28:12
he's

00:03:28:12 - 00:03:28:24
very

00:03:28:24 - 00:03:28:49
combo

00:03:28:49 - 00:03:29:13
centric.

00:03:29:13 - 00:03:29:20
So

00:03:29:20 - 00:03:29:29
like

00:03:29:29 - 00:03:29:34
you

00:03:29:34 - 00:03:29:45
get

00:03:29:45 - 00:03:29:51
you

00:03:29:51 - 00:03:30:00
get

00:03:30:00 - 00:03:30:16
one

00:03:30:16 - 00:03:30:43
blow

00:03:30:43 - 00:03:30:55
in

00:03:30:55 - 00:03:31:31
there

00:03:31:42 - 00:03:31:53
with

00:03:31:53 - 00:03:32:00
the

00:03:32:00 - 00:03:32:29
scorch

00:03:32:29 - 00:03:32:49
is AP

00:03:32:49 - 00:03:33:18
ratios

00:03:33:18 - 00:03:33:32
aren't

00:03:33:32 - 00:03:34:01
like

00:03:34:03 - 00:03:34:17
I mean

00:03:34:17 - 00:03:34:24
they're

00:03:34:24 - 00:03:34:35
not

00:03:34:35 - 00:03:35:13
terrible

00:03:35:13 - 00:03:35:43
but

00:03:35:43 - 00:03:36:23
yeah

00:03:36:37 - 00:03:37:10
basically

00:03:37:10 - 00:03:37:30
Scorch

00:03:37:30 - 00:03:37:42
has

00:03:37:42 - 00:03:37:53
to go

00:03:37:53 - 00:03:37:58
to

00:03:37:58 - 00:03:38:13
like

00:03:38:13 - 00:03:38:45
20

00:03:38:45 - 00:03:39:36
minutes

00:03:39:36 - 00:03:39:48
are

00:03:39:48 - 00:03:40:13
like

00:03:40:35 - 00:03:40:40
a

00:03:40:40 - 00:03:41:00
gathering

00:03:41:00 - 00:03:41:13
storm

00:03:41:13 - 00:03:41:20
has

00:03:41:20 - 00:03:41:24
to

00:03:41:24 - 00:03:41:36
get to

00:03:41:36 - 00:03:41:51
20

00:03:41:51 - 00:03:42:07
minutes

00:03:42:07 - 00:03:42:21
before

00:03:42:21 - 00:03:42:25
it

00:03:42:25 - 00:03:42:41
starts

00:03:42:41 - 00:03:42:50
like

00:03:42:50 - 00:03:43:28
consistently

00:03:43:28 - 00:03:43:35
out

00:03:43:35 - 00:03:44:34
damaging scorch.

00:03:44:34 - 00:03:44:45
And

00:03:44:45 - 00:03:45:01
it also

00:03:45:01 - 00:03:45:12
makes

00:03:45:12 - 00:03:45:18
this

00:03:45:18 - 00:03:45:34
planning

00:03:45:34 - 00:03:45:46
phase

00:03:45:46 - 00:03:45:57
a lot

00:03:45:57 - 00:03:46:24
worse.

00:03:46:24 - 00:03:46:33
Now,

00:03:46:33 - 00:03:46:40
the

00:03:46:40 - 00:03:47:01
comma

00:03:47:01 - 00:03:47:09
is

00:03:47:09 - 00:03:47:33
interesting

00:03:47:33 - 00:03:47:45
because

00:03:47:45 - 00:03:47:56
you have

00:03:47:56 - 00:03:48:03
to

00:03:48:03 - 00:03:48:18
assume

00:03:48:18 - 00:03:48:23
that

00:03:48:23 - 00:03:48:37
NAR is

00:03:48:37 - 00:03:48:45
going

00:03:48:45 - 00:03:48:54
to go

00:03:48:54 - 00:03:49:10
sleep

00:03:49:10 - 00:03:49:28
at work

00:03:49:28 - 00:03:49:35
and

00:03:49:35 - 00:03:49:40
then

00:03:49:40 - 00:03:49:46
he's

00:03:49:46 - 00:03:49:53
going

00:03:49:53 - 00:03:50:02
to go

00:03:50:02 - 00:03:50:22
resolve

00:03:50:22 - 00:03:50:31
with

00:03:50:31 - 00:03:50:43
the

00:03:50:43 - 00:03:51:07
shield.

00:03:52:22 - 00:03:52:28
I

00:03:52:28 - 00:03:52:42
don't

00:03:52:42 - 00:03:53:02
think

00:03:53:02 - 00:03:53:25
so.

00:03:53:25 - 00:03:54:00
I

00:03:54:00 - 00:03:54:12
think

00:03:54:12 - 00:03:54:18
the

00:03:54:18 - 00:03:54:50
comma

00:03:54:50 - 00:03:55:01
is

00:03:55:01 - 00:03:55:30
actually

00:03:55:30 - 00:03:56:34
not

00:03:56:34 - 00:03:57:32
particularly

00:03:57:32 - 00:03:58:01
great,

00:03:58:01 - 00:03:58:21
but

00:03:58:21 - 00:03:58:33
it's

00:03:58:33 - 00:03:59:24
whatever

00:03:59:24 - 00:03:59:51
threatening

00:03:59:51 - 00:04:00:05
Rome

00:04:00:05 - 00:04:00:10
and

00:04:00:10 - 00:04:00:25
looking

00:04:00:25 - 00:04:00:30
for

00:04:00:30 - 00:04:00:48
options

00:04:00:48 - 00:04:00:54
on

00:04:00:54 - 00:04:00:57
the

00:04:00:57 - 00:04:01:19
map.

00:04:01:30 - 00:04:01:53
Rivers

00:04:01:53 - 00:04:02:06
found

00:04:02:06 - 00:04:02:56
himself

00:04:03:05 - 00:04:03:18
this

00:04:03:18 - 00:04:03:30
tough

00:04:03:30 - 00:04:03:54
side

00:04:03:54 - 00:04:04:01
and

00:04:04:01 - 00:04:04:15
maybe

00:04:04:15 - 00:04:04:24
trying

00:04:04:24 - 00:04:04:30
to

00:04:04:30 - 00:04:04:42
burn

00:04:04:42 - 00:04:04:55
down

00:04:04:55 - 00:04:05:09
Ben.

00:04:05:09 - 00:04:05:16
Who

00:04:05:16 - 00:04:05:34
knows?

00:04:05:34 - 00:04:05:43
He's

00:04:05:43 - 00:04:06:03
in no

00:04:06:03 - 00:04:06:41
man's land.

00:04:06:41 - 00:04:06:55
He does

00:04:06:55 - 00:04:07:06
get a

00:04:07:06 - 00:04:07:21
good.

00:04:07:21 - 00:04:07:45
Okay,

00:04:07:48 - 00:04:08:00
Ben's

00:04:08:00 - 00:04:08:07
going

00:04:08:07 - 00:04:08:16
to get

00:04:08:16 - 00:04:08:27
away

00:04:08:27 - 00:04:08:47
there.

00:04:08:47 - 00:04:09:03
Yeah,

00:04:09:03 - 00:04:09:41
this is fine,

00:04:09:41 - 00:04:09:52
but I

00:04:09:52 - 00:04:10:02
think

00:04:10:02 - 00:04:10:10
has

00:04:10:10 - 00:04:10:13
the

00:04:10:13 - 00:04:10:24
right

00:04:10:24 - 00:04:10:58
approach.

00:04:10:58 - 00:04:11:34
No,

00:04:11:34 - 00:04:11:51
I will

00:04:11:51 - 00:04:12:01
come

00:04:12:01 - 00:04:12:15
up in

00:04:12:15 - 00:04:12:42
there.

00:04:13:17 - 00:04:13:30
I think

00:04:13:30 - 00:04:13:53
his approach

00:04:13:53 - 00:04:13:58
to

00:04:13:58 - 00:04:14:24
practice

00:04:14:24 - 00:04:14:29
is

00:04:14:29 - 00:04:14:40
one of

00:04:14:40 - 00:04:14:56
the worst

00:04:14:56 - 00:04:15:10
I've ever

00:04:15:10 - 00:04:15:22
seen.

00:04:15:22 - 00:04:16:04
He doesn't

00:04:16:04 - 00:04:16:12
know

00:04:16:12 - 00:04:16:19
that

00:04:16:19 - 00:04:16:28
he's

00:04:16:28 - 00:04:16:40
there,

00:04:16:40 - 00:04:16:46
and

00:04:16:46 - 00:04:16:57
now he

00:04:16:57 - 00:04:17:22
realizes

00:04:17:22 - 00:04:17:27
in

00:04:17:27 - 00:04:17:40
a bit

00:04:17:40 - 00:04:18:14
of a trouble.

00:04:18:14 - 00:04:18:37
Now

00:04:18:37 - 00:04:18:59
they waited

00:04:18:59 - 00:04:19:15
a couple

00:04:19:15 - 00:04:19:19
of

00:04:19:19 - 00:04:19:36
seconds,

00:04:19:36 - 00:04:19:42
kind

00:04:19:42 - 00:04:19:46
of

00:04:19:46 - 00:04:20:07
get himself

00:04:20:07 - 00:04:20:18
over

00:04:20:18 - 00:04:20:46
the wall

00:04:20:54 - 00:04:21:10
River

00:04:21:10 - 00:04:21:46
Stadium,

00:04:21:46 - 00:04:21:53
make

00:04:21:53 - 00:04:22:03
sure

00:04:22:03 - 00:04:22:19
he doesn't

00:04:22:19 - 00:04:22:28
lose

00:04:22:28 - 00:04:22:39
it.

00:04:22:50 - 00:04:23:26
Oh,

00:04:23:26 - 00:04:24:22
oh,

00:04:24:50 - 00:04:25:53
oh,

00:04:25:53 - 00:04:26:12
wait.

00:04:26:13 - 00:04:26:27
Oh,

00:04:26:27 - 00:04:26:31
he

00:04:26:31 - 00:04:26:49
just

00:04:26:49 - 00:04:26:58
he

A

00:04:35:06 - 00:04:35:43
spacing.

00:04:35:43 - 00:04:35:57
Oh,

00:04:35:57 - 00:04:36:10
it doesn't

00:04:36:10 - 00:04:36:25
matter.

00:04:36:25 - 00:04:36:32
Does

00:04:36:32 - 00:04:36:35
it

00:04:36:35 - 00:04:36:52
matter?

00:04:36:52 - 00:04:37:04
There's

00:04:37:04 - 00:04:37:08
a

00:04:37:08 - 00:04:37:48

I love

00:04:40:15 - 00:04:40:24
the

00:04:40:24 - 00:04:41:06
emotes

00:04:41:06 - 00:04:41:13

00:04:41:13 - 00:04:41:34
secure

00:04:41:34 - 00:04:41:42
this.

00:04:41:42 - 00:04:42:00
They haven't

00:04:42:00 - 00:04:42:10
gotten

00:04:42:10 - 00:04:42:16
it

00:04:42:16 - 00:04:42:30

00:04:42:45 - 00:04:43:01
Okay,

They

00:04:43:06 - 00:04:43:15

00:04:43:15 - 00:04:43:30

00:04:43:31 - 00:04:43:49
All right.

No

Gauri

00:05:02:49 - 00:05:02:58
is

00:05:02:58 - 00:05:03:14
actually

00:05:03:14 - 00:05:03:23
just

00:05:03:23 - 00:05:03:36
getting

00:05:03:36 - 00:05:03:57
like

00:05:04:15 - 00:05:05:07
like clapped

00:05:05:07 - 00:05:06:00
Oh my God

Miss

00:05:06:12 - 00:05:06:36
Glass

00:05:06:36 - 00:05:07:22
chemist

00:05:07:22 - 00:05:07:31
and

00:05:07:55 - 00:05:08:07
I mean

00:05:08:07 - 00:05:08:16
it's

00:05:08:16 - 00:05:08:31
fine

00:05:08:31 - 00:05:08:56
though

00:05:08:56 - 00:05:09:12
we need

00:05:09:12 - 00:05:09:27
to get

00:05:09:27 - 00:05:09:36
you

00:05:09:36 - 00:05:09:57
rolling

00:05:09:57 - 00:05:10:15
rivers

00:05:10:15 - 00:05:10:33
on two

00:05:10:33 - 00:05:10:49
camps

00:05:10:49 - 00:05:11:07
right now

00:05:11:07 - 00:05:11:15
so

00:05:11:15 - 00:05:11:24
it's a

00:05:11:24 - 00:05:11:33
little

00:05:11:33 - 00:05:11:38
bit

00:05:11:38 - 00:05:11:54
bad.

00:05:11:54 - 00:05:12:27
Yeah

00:05:12:37 - 00:05:13:03
at this

00:05:13:03 - 00:05:13:31
point

00:05:13:31 - 00:05:14:06
the problem

00:05:14:06 - 00:05:14:20
is is

00:05:14:20 - 00:05:14:29
that

00:05:14:29 - 00:05:14:56
river.

00:05:14:56 - 00:05:15:21
River

00:05:15:21 - 00:05:16:06
is

00:05:16:06 - 00:05:16:15
what

00:05:16:15 - 00:05:16:19
it

00:05:16:19 - 00:05:16:48
was.

00:05:16:48 - 00:05:17:06
He's

00:05:17:06 - 00:05:17:27
down

00:05:17:27 - 00:05:17:49
three

00:05:17:49 - 00:05:18:10
jungle

00:05:18:10 - 00:05:18:48
camps.

00:05:18:48 - 00:05:19:01
He's

00:05:19:01 - 00:05:19:15
down

00:05:19:15 - 00:05:19:31
so

00:05:19:31 - 00:05:19:44
much

00:05:19:44 - 00:05:20:20
the XP

00:05:20:20 - 00:05:20:31
to

00:05:20:31 - 00:05:21:18
zoom

00:05:21:18 - 00:05:21:39
bandage

00:05:21:39 - 00:05:21:50
to

00:05:22:03 - 00:05:22:13
like

00:05:22:13 - 00:05:22:33
he needs

00:05:22:33 - 00:05:22:44
two

00:05:22:44 - 00:05:23:02
camps

00:05:23:02 - 00:05:23:16
just

00:05:23:16 - 00:05:23:22
to

00:05:23:22 - 00:05:23:34
match

00:05:23:34 - 00:05:24:00
Zune

00:05:24:00 - 00:05:24:09
on

00:05:24:09 - 00:05:25:01
the XP.

00:05:25:01 - 00:05:25:12
And

00:05:25:12 - 00:05:25:37
the problem

00:05:25:37 - 00:05:25:51
is, is

00:05:25:51 - 00:05:25:58
that

00:05:25:58 - 00:05:26:38
they know

00:05:26:38 - 00:05:26:58
where

00:05:26:58 - 00:05:27:19
River

00:05:27:19 - 00:05:27:30
is

00:05:27:30 - 00:05:27:37
going

00:05:27:37 - 00:05:27:46
to be

00:05:27:46 - 00:05:28:04
going

00:05:28:04 - 00:05:28:44
now.

00:05:28:55 - 00:05:29:04
So

00:05:29:04 - 00:05:29:09
it's

00:05:29:09 - 00:05:29:20
kind

00:05:29:20 - 00:05:29:24
of

00:05:29:24 - 00:05:29:31
like

00:05:29:31 - 00:05:29:34
they

00:05:29:34 - 00:05:29:42
have

00:05:29:42 - 00:05:29:58
map

00:05:29:58 - 00:05:30:42
packs.

00:05:30:46 - 00:05:31:15
The Kindred

00:05:31:15 - 00:05:31:19
is

00:05:31:19 - 00:05:31:30
just

00:05:31:30 - 00:05:31:51
so far

00:05:31:51 - 00:05:32:31
behind

00:05:32:31 - 00:05:32:43
and

00:05:32:43 - 00:05:33:01
also

00:05:33:01 - 00:05:33:32
near

00:05:33:32 - 00:05:33:54
with

00:05:33:54 - 00:05:33:59
the

00:05:33:59 - 00:05:34:10
two

00:05:34:10 - 00:05:34:26
kills

00:05:34:26 - 00:05:34:35
being

00:05:34:35 - 00:05:34:42
able

00:05:34:42 - 00:05:34:51
to get

00:05:34:51 - 00:05:34:57
the

00:05:34:57 - 00:05:35:09
merge

00:05:35:09 - 00:05:35:33
treads

00:05:35:33 - 00:05:35:42
and

00:05:35:42 - 00:05:36:10
basically

00:05:36:10 - 00:05:36:21
like

00:05:36:21 - 00:05:36:36
not

00:05:36:36 - 00:05:36:48
being

00:05:36:48 - 00:05:37:06
punished

00:05:37:06 - 00:05:37:17
for

00:05:37:17 - 00:05:37:21
it.

00:05:37:21 - 00:05:37:28
And

00:05:37:28 - 00:05:38:00
Layne

00:05:38:00 - 00:05:38:08
the

00:05:38:08 - 00:05:38:29

00:05:38:33 - 00:05:38:40
just

00:05:38:40 - 00:05:38:47
going

00:05:38:47 - 00:05:38:51
to

00:05:38:51 - 00:05:39:01
fall

00:05:39:01 - 00:05:39:23
so far

00:05:39:23 - 00:05:39:41
behind

00:05:39:41 - 00:05:40:13
now

00:05:40:25 - 00:05:40:42
dog

00:05:40:42 - 00:05:41:07
can start

00:05:41:07 - 00:05:41:13
to

00:05:41:13 - 00:05:41:29
threaten

00:05:41:29 - 00:05:42:25

00:05:42:25 - 00:05:42:39

00:05:42:39 - 00:05:42:52
Lane

00:05:42:52 - 00:05:42:59
is

00:05:42:59 - 00:05:43:24
beginning

00:05:43:24 - 00:05:43:31
to

00:05:43:31 - 00:05:43:55
stack

00:05:43:55 - 00:05:44:02
up

00:05:44:02 - 00:05:44:33
a wave.

00:05:44:33 - 00:05:44:58
Gori

00:05:44:58 - 00:05:45:14
needs

00:05:45:14 - 00:05:45:27
to be

00:05:45:27 - 00:05:46:37
careful

00:05:46:37 - 00:05:46:49
as he

00:05:46:49 - 00:05:47:07
walks

00:05:47:07 - 00:05:47:16
into

00:05:47:16 - 00:05:47:45
falls.

00:05:47:49 - 00:05:48:28
Oh, my

00:05:48:28 - 00:05:49:19
Lord.

00:05:49:19 - 00:05:49:42
Okay,

00:05:49:42 - 00:05:50:00
Corey

00:05:50:00 - 00:05:50:09
just

00:05:50:09 - 00:05:50:22
takes

00:05:50:22 - 00:05:51:37
a lot of damage.

00:05:51:43 - 00:05:51:55
All right.

00:05:51:55 - 00:05:52:13
Gory

00:05:52:13 - 00:05:52:31
iron,

00:05:52:31 - 00:05:52:44
gory

00:05:52:44 - 00:05:52:55
can

00:05:52:55 - 00:05:53:06
take

00:05:53:06 - 00:05:53:13
that.

00:05:53:13 - 00:05:53:22
You

00:05:53:22 - 00:05:53:33
can

00:05:53:33 - 00:05:53:43
take

00:05:53:43 - 00:05:53:57
the.

00:05:54:55 - 00:05:55:03
They

00:05:55:03 - 00:05:55:10
want

00:05:55:10 - 00:05:55:13
to

00:05:55:13 - 00:05:55:33
continue

00:05:55:33 - 00:05:55:46
going

00:05:55:46 - 00:05:55:49
for

00:05:55:49 - 00:05:56:00
this

00:05:56:00 - 00:05:56:06
one.

00:05:56:06 - 00:05:56:13
We

00:05:56:13 - 00:05:56:19
are.

00:05:56:40 - 00:05:57:14
Oh, my

00:05:57:14 - 00:05:57:57
Lord.

00:05:57:57 - 00:05:58:33
Wait,

00:05:58:44 - 00:05:59:04
What

00:05:59:04 - 00:05:59:16
the

00:05:59:16 - 00:05:59:36
hell

00:05:59:36 - 00:05:59:58
is

00:05:59:58 - 00:06:00:16
gory?

00:06:00:16 - 00:06:00:30
Doesn't

00:06:00:30 - 00:06:00:41
have

00:06:00:41 - 00:06:00:55
to

00:06:00:55 - 00:06:01:13
wait.

00:06:01:13 - 00:06:01:21
Oh,

00:06:01:21 - 00:06:01:28
my

00:06:01:28 - 00:06:01:37
God.

00:06:01:37 - 00:06:02:15
Where have

00:06:02:15 - 00:06:02:20
they

00:06:02:20 - 00:06:02:28
got

00:06:02:28 - 00:06:02:34
him

00:06:02:34 - 00:06:03:07
anyway?

00:06:03:10 - 00:06:03:23
That's

00:06:03:23 - 00:06:03:36
over.

00:06:03:36 - 00:06:03:45
It's

00:06:03:45 - 00:06:04:17
over.

00:06:04:31 - 00:06:05:06
Elk is

00:06:05:06 - 00:06:05:36
actually

00:06:05:36 - 00:06:05:56
cracked

00:06:05:56 - 00:06:06:01
out

00:06:06:01 - 00:06:06:10
of his

00:06:06:10 - 00:06:06:43
mind.

00:06:07:08 - 00:06:07:19
For

00:06:07:19 - 00:06:07:30
those

00:06:07:30 - 00:06:07:37
that

00:06:07:37 - 00:06:07:46
don't

00:06:07:46 - 00:06:07:57
know,

00:06:07:57 - 00:06:08:11
he has

00:06:08:11 - 00:06:08:24
missed

00:06:08:24 - 00:06:08:45
one.

00:06:08:45 - 00:06:09:36
Yes,

00:06:10:03 - 00:06:10:24
he has

00:06:10:24 - 00:06:10:57
missed

00:06:10:57 - 00:06:11:45
one

00:06:11:45 - 00:06:13:12
since

00:06:13:12 - 00:06:13:24
this

00:06:13:24 - 00:06:13:49
entire

00:06:13:49 - 00:06:14:29
game.

00:06:15:14 - 00:06:15:55
This is

00:06:15:55 - 00:06:17:15
unholy,

00:06:17:15 - 00:06:17:45
man.

00:06:17:45 - 00:06:18:01
He's

00:06:18:01 - 00:06:18:16
missed

00:06:18:16 - 00:06:19:21
one

00:06:20:06 - 00:06:20:27
speaking

00:06:20:27 - 00:06:20:36
all

00:06:20:36 - 00:06:21:00
forever.

00:06:21:00 - 00:06:21:07
We'll

00:06:21:07 - 00:06:21:23
go for

00:06:21:23 - 00:06:21:32
a bit

00:06:21:32 - 00:06:22:03
of a trade,

00:06:22:03 - 00:06:22:16
but

00:06:22:28 - 00:06:24:03
my God.

00:06:24:03 - 00:06:24:27
Perfect.

00:06:24:27 - 00:06:24:39
See

00:06:24:39 - 00:06:24:55
us at

00:06:24:55 - 00:06:25:15
10

00:06:25:15 - 00:06:25:55
minutes

00:06:26:15 - 00:06:26:33
before

00:06:26:33 - 00:06:27:03
the 1030

00:06:27:03 - 00:06:27:16
wave

00:06:27:16 - 00:06:27:45
arrives

00:06:27:45 - 00:06:29:07
Is 107

00:06:29:07 - 00:06:29:43
help

00:06:30:21 - 00:06:30:34
yet?

00:06:30:34 - 00:06:31:22
112

00:06:31:22 - 00:06:31:42
farm.

00:06:31:42 - 00:06:31:48
He

00:06:31:48 - 00:06:32:02
missed

00:06:32:02 - 00:06:32:22
one

00:06:32:22 - 00:06:32:56
six.

00:06:32:56 - 00:06:33:03
That's

00:06:33:03 - 00:06:33:10
why

00:06:33:10 - 00:06:33:18
they

00:06:33:18 - 00:06:33:25
kind

00:06:33:25 - 00:06:33:28
of

00:06:33:28 - 00:06:33:55
started.

00:06:33:55 - 00:06:34:17
Oh

00:06:34:17 - 00:06:35:34
my God,

00:06:35:34 - 00:06:35:40
we

00:06:35:40 - 00:06:35:51
can't

00:06:35:51 - 00:06:36:00
take

00:06:36:00 - 00:06:36:09
this

00:06:36:09 - 00:06:36:25
fight.

00:06:36:25 - 00:06:36:32
And

00:06:36:32 - 00:06:37:17
immediately

00:06:37:17 - 00:06:37:28
have to

00:06:37:28 - 00:06:37:48
flush away

00:06:37:48 - 00:06:37:57
because

00:06:37:57 - 00:06:38:11
there was

00:06:38:11 - 00:06:38:15
a

00:06:38:15 - 00:06:39:23
graviton.

00:06:39:23 - 00:06:39:34
How

00:06:39:34 - 00:06:39:50
we got

00:06:39:50 - 00:06:40:01
to

00:06:40:01 - 00:06:40:17
wards

00:06:40:17 - 00:06:40:44
okay.

00:06:40:44 - 00:06:41:00
Three.

00:06:41:00 - 00:06:41:25
Yes. A

00:06:42:32 - 00:06:42:57
washed

00:06:42:57 - 00:06:43:51
up man

00:06:43:51 - 00:06:44:18
honestly

00:06:44:18 - 00:06:44:31
missed

00:06:44:31 - 00:06:44:42
three

00:06:44:42 - 00:06:45:10
six.

00:06:45:10 - 00:06:45:25
I think

00:06:45:25 - 00:06:45:30
it's

00:06:45:30 - 00:06:45:39
time

00:06:45:39 - 00:06:45:45
to

00:06:45:45 - 00:06:46:06
replace

00:06:46:06 - 00:06:46:30
them.

00:06:46:37 - 00:06:46:57
Teams

00:06:46:57 - 00:06:47:19
would be

00:06:47:19 - 00:06:47:36
looking

00:06:47:36 - 00:06:47:47
a bit

00:06:47:47 - 00:06:48:16
jittery

00:06:48:16 - 00:06:48:27
at the

00:06:48:27 - 00:06:48:45
moment

00:06:48:45 - 00:06:48:50
as

00:06:48:50 - 00:06:48:54
they

00:06:48:54 - 00:06:49:03
look

00:06:49:03 - 00:06:49:16
for a

00:06:49:16 - 00:06:49:33
straight

00:06:49:33 - 00:06:50:09
what?

00:06:50:20 - 00:06:50:38
He just

00:06:50:38 - 00:06:50:58
popped

00:06:50:58 - 00:06:51:14
his red

00:06:51:14 - 00:06:51:50
pot.

00:06:52:12 - 00:06:52:21
He

00:06:52:21 - 00:06:52:39
popped

00:06:52:39 - 00:06:52:58
his red

00:06:52:58 - 00:06:53:15
pot.

00:06:53:15 - 00:06:53:29
So

00:06:53:29 - 00:06:53:38
you know

00:06:53:38 - 00:06:53:45
what

00:06:53:45 - 00:06:53:54
that

00:06:53:54 - 00:06:54:10
means?

00:06:54:10 - 00:06:54:16
It

00:06:54:16 - 00:06:54:28
means

00:06:54:28 - 00:06:54:43
sticks

00:06:54:43 - 00:06:54:52
is

00:06:54:52 - 00:06:55:04
about

00:06:55:04 - 00:06:55:19
to get

00:06:55:19 - 00:06:55:37
big.

00:06:55:37 - 00:06:56:06
They're

00:06:56:07 - 00:06:56:24
laying

00:06:56:24 - 00:06:56:51
around.

00:06:56:51 - 00:06:57:00
He

00:06:57:00 - 00:06:57:18
popped

00:06:57:18 - 00:06:57:34
a red

00:06:57:34 - 00:06:57:54
pot at

00:06:57:54 - 00:06:58:40
75%

00:06:58:40 - 00:06:59:27
HP.

00:06:59:27 - 00:07:00:00
So Elk

00:07:00:00 - 00:07:00:09
is

00:07:00:09 - 00:07:00:32
thinking

00:07:00:32 - 00:07:00:39
that

00:07:00:39 - 00:07:01:03
something

00:07:01:03 - 00:07:01:10
is

00:07:01:10 - 00:07:01:28
about

00:07:01:28 - 00:07:01:58
to happen.

00:07:01:58 - 00:07:02:20
He needs

00:07:02:20 - 00:07:02:49
the HP

00:07:02:49 - 00:07:03:32
for it.

00:07:03:46 - 00:07:04:03
Oh,

00:07:04:03 - 00:07:04:17
my

00:07:04:17 - 00:07:04:39
God.

00:07:04:39 - 00:07:05:04
This is

00:07:05:04 - 00:07:05:15
what

00:07:05:15 - 00:07:05:20
he

00:07:05:20 - 00:07:05:34
thought

00:07:05:34 - 00:07:05:45
was

00:07:05:45 - 00:07:06:00
about

00:07:06:00 - 00:07:06:07
to

00:07:06:07 - 00:07:06:52
happen

00:07:06:52 - 00:07:07:03
to get

00:07:07:03 - 00:07:07:32
the ultimate

00:07:07:32 - 00:07:07:40
from

00:07:07:40 - 00:07:08:00
the VI

00:07:08:00 - 00:07:08:15
as

00:07:08:15 - 00:07:08:28
well.

00:07:08:28 - 00:07:08:47
Nobody's

00:07:08:47 - 00:07:09:03
gone.

00:07:09:03 - 00:07:09:32
Oh,

00:07:09:32 - 00:07:10:04
my

00:07:10:04 - 00:07:10:58
Lord,

00:07:10:58 - 00:07:11:11
There's

00:07:11:11 - 00:07:12:07
a bailout.

00:07:12:07 - 00:07:12:23
All right,

00:07:12:23 - 00:07:12:34
It's

00:07:12:34 - 00:07:12:46
over.

00:07:12:46 - 00:07:12:57
It

00:07:12:57 - 00:07:13:10
goes

00:07:13:10 - 00:07:13:40
down.

00:07:13:40 - 00:07:13:49
They're

00:07:13:49 - 00:07:14:04
looking

00:07:14:04 - 00:07:14:15
to try

00:07:14:15 - 00:07:14:20
and

00:07:14:20 - 00:07:14:24
see

00:07:14:24 - 00:07:14:27
if

00:07:14:27 - 00:07:14:31
they

00:07:14:31 - 00:07:14:36
can

00:07:14:36 - 00:07:14:52
catch

00:07:14:52 - 00:07:15:01
out.

00:07:15:01 - 00:07:15:18
Gory

00:07:15:18 - 00:07:15:25
as

00:07:15:25 - 00:07:15:36
well.

00:07:15:36 - 00:07:15:43
Who

00:07:15:43 - 00:07:15:55
did

00:07:15:55 - 00:07:16:01
have

00:07:16:01 - 00:07:16:04
the

00:07:16:04 - 00:07:16:21
Flash

00:07:16:21 - 00:07:16:30
over

00:07:16:30 - 00:07:16:33
the

00:07:16:33 - 00:07:16:49
wall?

00:07:16:49 - 00:07:18:03
Oh, my

00:07:18:03 - 00:07:19:24
God.

00:07:19:24 - 00:07:19:40
All right,

00:07:19:40 - 00:07:19:48
it's

00:07:19:48 - 00:07:20:24
over.

00:07:20:29 - 00:07:20:58
I don't even know

00:07:20:58 - 00:07:21:05
why

00:07:21:05 - 00:07:21:12
they're

00:07:21:12 - 00:07:21:30
fighting

00:07:21:30 - 00:07:21:36
for

00:07:21:36 - 00:07:22:01
this

00:07:22:01 - 00:07:22:21
Golden

00:07:22:21 - 00:07:22:58
Guardians.

00:07:22:58 - 00:07:23:18
I don't know

00:07:23:18 - 00:07:23:31
why

00:07:23:31 - 00:07:23:38
they're

00:07:23:38 - 00:07:23:54
fighting

00:07:23:54 - 00:07:24:00
for

00:07:24:00 - 00:07:24:14
this

00:07:24:14 - 00:07:24:37
position.

00:07:24:37 - 00:07:25:03
They're down

00:07:25:03 - 00:07:25:21
so

00:07:25:21 - 00:07:25:35
much

00:07:25:35 - 00:07:26:22
gold,

00:07:26:22 - 00:07:26:52
they don't

00:07:26:52 - 00:07:27:09
have

00:07:27:09 - 00:07:27:23
mal

00:07:27:23 - 00:07:27:55
fight

00:07:27:55 - 00:07:28:26
unleashed.

00:07:28:26 - 00:07:28:55
Teleport

00:07:28:55 - 00:07:29:22
is not

00:07:29:22 - 00:07:29:58
available.

00:07:29:58 - 00:07:30:19
James

00:07:30:19 - 00:07:30:30
is

00:07:30:30 - 00:07:30:52
pushed

00:07:30:52 - 00:07:31:03
in.

00:07:31:03 - 00:07:31:22
Ophelia

00:07:31:22 - 00:07:31:33
says

00:07:31:33 - 00:07:31:48
first

00:07:31:48 - 00:07:32:25
move.

00:07:32:25 - 00:07:32:47
So

00:07:32:47 - 00:07:34:06
honestly,

00:07:34:06 - 00:07:34:22
if

00:07:34:22 - 00:07:34:35
this

00:07:34:35 - 00:07:34:46
was

00:07:34:46 - 00:07:35:16
biology

00:07:35:16 - 00:07:35:38
versus

00:07:35:38 - 00:07:36:03
biology,

00:07:36:03 - 00:07:36:12
I'd

00:07:36:12 - 00:07:36:23
say

00:07:36:23 - 00:07:36:50
bulges

00:07:36:50 - 00:07:37:04
I had

00:07:37:04 - 00:07:37:22
because of

00:07:37:22 - 00:07:37:46
comp,

00:07:37:46 - 00:07:38:29
I really

00:07:38:29 - 00:07:38:40
wouldn't

00:07:38:40 - 00:07:38:51
say

00:07:38:51 - 00:07:38:56
that

00:07:38:56 - 00:07:39:05
they

00:07:39:05 - 00:07:39:16
are

00:07:39:16 - 00:07:39:32

half

00:07:42:01 - 00:07:42:52
thousand,

00:07:43:03 - 00:07:43:15
but

00:07:43:15 - 00:07:44:15
they have

00:07:44:15 - 00:07:45:09
Drake.

00:07:45:36 - 00:07:45:57
They have

00:07:45:57 - 00:07:46:17

00:07:50:43 - 00:07:50:58
honest,

00:07:50:58 - 00:07:51:05
they're

00:07:51:05 - 00:07:51:36

00:07:54:52 - 00:07:55:03
look,

Oh,

Oh,

Oh,

00:08:04:36 - 00:08:04:45
They're.

00:08:04:57 - 00:08:06:09
Oh, my

00:08:06:09 - 00:08:07:37
God.

00:08:07:37 - 00:08:07:58
What

00:08:07:58 - 00:08:09:54
are we doing?

00:08:09:54 - 00:08:10:03
They're

00:08:10:03 - 00:08:10:13
looking

00:08:10:13 - 00:08:10:24
for an

00:08:10:24 - 00:08:10:28
in

00:08:10:28 - 00:08:10:40
game.

00:08:10:40 - 00:08:11:02
Oh,

00:08:11:02 - 00:08:11:18
that's

00:08:11:18 - 00:08:11:27
what

00:08:11:27 - 00:08:11:36
they're

00:08:11:36 - 00:08:12:32
doing.

dust.

00:08:16:31 - 00:08:17:00
Glory

00:08:17:00 - 00:08:17:29

00:08:18:05 - 00:08:18:21
about.

00:08:18:21 - 00:08:18:39
Never

00:08:18:39 - 00:08:18:54
mind,

00:08:18:54 - 00:08:19:08
guys.

00:08:19:08 - 00:08:19:21
Never

00:08:19:21 - 00:08:19:33
mind,

00:08:19:33 - 00:08:19:51

00:08:24:10 - 00:08:25:10
disaster

00:08:25:10 - 00:08:25:22
for

00:08:25:22 - 00:08:25:37
them.

00:08:26:00 - 00:08:26:33
Oh,

00:08:26:33 - 00:08:27:03
my

00:08:27:03 - 00:08:27:39
God.

00:08:27:39 - 00:08:28:35
I'd

00:08:28:48 - 00:08:29:20
imagine

00:08:29:20 - 00:08:29:27
if

00:08:29:27 - 00:08:30:00
Kindred

00:08:30:00 - 00:08:30:10
could

00:08:30:10 - 00:08:30:33
press

00:08:30:33 - 00:08:31:12
already

00:08:31:12 - 00:08:31:49
imagining

00:08:31:49 - 00:08:31:53
a

00:08:31:53 - 00:08:32:17
kindred

00:08:32:17 - 00:08:32:27
could

00:08:32:27 - 00:08:32:47
press

00:08:32:47 - 00:08:33:07
are.

00:08:34:04 - 00:08:35:02
Oh, my

00:08:35:02 - 00:08:36:27
God.

00:08:36:27 - 00:08:36:43
From

00:08:36:43 - 00:08:37:46
the LG

00:08:37:46 - 00:08:38:24
Watch.

00:08:38:24 - 00:08:38:34
Let's

00:08:38:34 - 00:08:38:42
look

00:08:38:42 - 00:08:38:45
at

00:08:38:45 - 00:08:38:52
this

00:08:38:52 - 00:08:39:00
one

00:08:39:00 - 00:08:39:05
more

00:08:39:05 - 00:08:39:34
time.

00:08:39:46 - 00:08:40:26
The game is

00:08:40:26 - 00:08:40:53
so

00:08:40:53 - 00:08:42:01
free.

00:08:42:12 - 00:08:42:23
Look

00:08:42:23 - 00:08:42:36
at this.

00:08:42:36 - 00:08:42:46
Look,

00:08:42:46 - 00:08:43:05
look.

00:08:43:15 - 00:08:43:28
They

00:08:43:28 - 00:08:43:49
get the

00:08:43:49 - 00:08:44:36
herald.

00:08:44:36 - 00:08:44:52
They

00:08:44:52 - 00:08:45:23
engage

00:08:45:23 - 00:08:46:04
on

00:08:46:04 - 00:08:46:21
six

00:08:46:21 - 00:08:46:35
days

00:08:46:35 - 00:08:46:53
Auto

00:08:46:53 - 00:08:47:00
ring

00:08:47:00 - 00:08:47:52
award.

00:08:47:52 - 00:08:48:39
Okay.

00:08:48:39 - 00:08:49:13
Pheromones

00:08:49:13 - 00:08:49:24
go

00:08:49:24 - 00:08:49:35
out.

00:08:49:35 - 00:08:49:40
The

00:08:49:40 - 00:08:50:04
pheromones

00:08:50:04 - 00:08:50:29
are terrible

00:08:50:29 - 00:08:50:51
because

00:08:50:51 - 00:08:51:37
it's

00:08:51:37 - 00:08:52:04
excessive.

00:08:52:04 - 00:08:52:06
It

00:08:52:06 - 00:08:52:17
should have

00:08:52:17 - 00:08:52:22
been

00:08:52:22 - 00:08:52:44
on the

00:08:53:06 - 00:08:53:32
long

00:08:53:32 - 00:08:54:28
river

00:08:54:28 - 00:08:54:55
right

00:08:54:55 - 00:08:55:44
before

00:08:55:44 - 00:08:56:02
that

00:08:56:02 - 00:08:56:52
happens.

00:08:56:52 - 00:08:57:14
Right

00:08:57:14 - 00:08:57:36
before

00:08:57:36 - 00:08:57:50
on

00:08:57:50 - 00:08:58:21
connects.

00:08:58:21 - 00:08:58:35
If

00:08:58:35 - 00:08:58:58
River

00:08:58:58 - 00:08:59:18
gets

00:08:59:18 - 00:08:59:54
the r

00:08:59:54 - 00:09:00:12
b

00:09:00:12 - 00:09:00:34
lg

00:09:00:34 - 00:09:00:59
lose

00:09:00:59 - 00:09:01:51
the fight

00:09:01:51 - 00:09:01:58
for

00:09:01:58 - 00:09:02:22
the fact

00:09:02:22 - 00:09:02:36
that

00:09:02:58 - 00:09:03:14
they

00:09:03:14 - 00:09:04:04
actually

00:09:04:04 - 00:09:04:46
lose

00:09:04:46 - 00:09:05:47
the fight.

00:09:05:47 - 00:09:06:27
Now,

00:09:06:43 - 00:09:07:12
we always

00:09:07:12 - 00:09:07:22
talk

00:09:07:22 - 00:09:07:35
about

00:09:07:35 - 00:09:07:42
an

00:09:07:42 - 00:09:08:32
analysis,

00:09:08:32 - 00:09:08:52
the way

00:09:08:52 - 00:09:09:00
that

00:09:09:00 - 00:09:09:21
things

00:09:09:21 - 00:09:09:41
are

00:09:09:41 - 00:09:10:49
perceived.

00:09:10:51 - 00:09:11:07
I

00:09:11:07 - 00:09:11:31
perceive

00:09:11:31 - 00:09:11:42
this

00:09:11:42 - 00:09:12:07
fight

00:09:12:07 - 00:09:12:27
as

00:09:12:27 - 00:09:13:22
biology

00:09:13:22 - 00:09:13:35
are

00:09:13:35 - 00:09:14:04
making

00:09:14:04 - 00:09:14:13
a

00:09:14:13 - 00:09:14:51
horrendous

00:09:14:51 - 00:09:15:28
decision.

00:09:15:28 - 00:09:16:21
Okay,

00:09:16:24 - 00:09:16:55
In my

00:09:16:55 - 00:09:17:33
mind,

00:09:17:33 - 00:09:18:03
biology

00:09:18:03 - 00:09:18:37
loses

00:09:18:37 - 00:09:18:57
points

00:09:18:57 - 00:09:19:04
for

00:09:19:04 - 00:09:19:15
this

00:09:19:15 - 00:09:19:58
play.

00:09:20:11 - 00:09:21:07
I do not care

00:09:21:07 - 00:09:21:21
about

00:09:21:21 - 00:09:22:03
the outcome.

00:09:22:03 - 00:09:22:35
I care

00:09:22:35 - 00:09:22:42
that

00:09:22:42 - 00:09:22:55
they

00:09:22:55 - 00:09:23:51
actually

00:09:23:51 - 00:09:24:18
committed

00:09:24:18 - 00:09:24:28
to

00:09:24:28 - 00:09:25:13
a play

00:09:25:13 - 00:09:25:35
that is

00:09:25:35 - 00:09:26:09
game.

00:09:26:09 - 00:09:26:58
Losing

00:09:26:58 - 00:09:27:19
it is

00:09:27:19 - 00:09:28:48
catastrophically

00:09:28:48 - 00:09:29:34
bad.

00:09:29:43 - 00:09:29:47
You

00:09:29:47 - 00:09:29:52
have

00:09:29:52 - 00:09:30:18
a process

00:09:30:18 - 00:09:30:34
good

00:09:30:34 - 00:09:30:43
and

00:09:30:43 - 00:09:31:04
he's

00:09:31:04 - 00:09:31:33
but

00:09:31:33 - 00:09:31:53
river

00:09:31:53 - 00:09:32:06
doesn't

00:09:32:06 - 00:09:32:18
press

00:09:32:18 - 00:09:32:40
art.

00:09:33:12 - 00:09:33:28
Okay

00:09:33:28 - 00:09:33:39
wait,

00:09:33:39 - 00:09:33:48
hold

00:09:33:48 - 00:09:34:10
on.

00:09:34:19 - 00:09:34:26
I'll

00:09:34:26 - 00:09:34:35
show

00:09:34:35 - 00:09:34:51
cable

00:09:34:51 - 00:09:35:04
after

00:09:35:04 - 00:09:35:20
the fight.

00:09:35:20 - 00:09:35:27
Here

00:09:35:27 - 00:09:35:42
we go.

00:09:35:42 - 00:09:35:47
Here

00:09:35:47 - 00:09:36:12
we go.

00:09:36:12 - 00:09:36:31
We go

00:09:36:31 - 00:09:36:37

00:09:36:37 - 00:09:36:41

00:09:37:39 - 00:09:37:49

00:09:38:04 - 00:09:38:27
Okay.

00:09:38:27 - 00:09:38:45
All right,

00:09:38:45 - 00:09:39:03

00:09:42:48 - 00:09:44:04
down.

00:09:44:04 - 00:09:44:20
Oh,

00:09:44:20 - 00:09:44:51
my

00:09:44:51 - 00:09:45:28
God.

00:09:45:28 - 00:09:45:46
Double

00:09:45:46 - 00:09:45:54
of

00:09:45:54 - 00:09:46:08
kills

00:09:46:08 - 00:09:46:21

00:09:46:21 - 00:09:46:35
there,

00:09:46:35 - 00:09:47:16
Saundra.

00:09:47:16 - 00:09:47:40
Oh,

00:09:47:40 - 00:09:47:45
and

00:09:47:45 - 00:09:48:07
Gory

00:09:48:07 - 00:09:48:21
goes

00:09:48:21 - 00:09:49:08
down

00:09:49:08 - 00:09:49:24
first.

00:09:49:24 - 00:09:49:31
This

00:09:49:31 - 00:09:49:40
one

00:09:49:40 - 00:09:49:55
down.

00:09:49:55 - 00:09:50:06
Oh,

00:09:50:06 - 00:09:50:19
but

00:09:50:19 - 00:09:50:34
they

00:09:50:34 - 00:09:51:03
still

00:09:51:39 - 00:09:52:03
break.

00:09:52:03 - 00:09:52:10
All

00:09:52:10 - 00:09:52:33
the Guardians

00:09:52:33 - 00:09:52:35
are

00:09:52:35 - 00:09:52:42
going

00:09:52:42 - 00:09:53:27
to win

00:09:53:27 - 00:09:53:31
the

00:09:53:31 - 00:09:53:46
fight.

00:09:53:46 - 00:09:54:10
Ben

00:09:54:14 - 00:09:54:30
Oh, my

00:09:54:30 - 00:09:54:58
God.

00:09:54:58 - 00:09:55:22
Threw

00:09:55:22 - 00:09:55:30
on

00:09:55:30 - 00:09:55:37
the

00:09:55:37 - 00:09:56:01
ark.

00:09:56:06 - 00:09:56:34
Oh,

00:09:56:34 - 00:09:57:21
okay.

00:09:57:45 - 00:09:57:54
Can

00:09:57:54 - 00:09:57:59
they

00:09:57:59 - 00:09:58:13
trade

00:09:58:13 - 00:09:58:24
one

00:09:58:24 - 00:09:58:37
more?

00:09:58:37 - 00:09:58:46
Can

00:09:58:46 - 00:09:58:51
they

00:09:58:51 - 00:09:59:04
trade

00:09:59:04 - 00:09:59:11
one

00:09:59:11 - 00:09:59:20
more?

00:09:59:20 - 00:09:59:27
They

00:09:59:27 - 00:09:59:47
can't.

00:09:59:47 - 00:10:00:00
Oh,

00:10:00:00 - 00:10:00:12
my

00:10:00:12 - 00:10:00:57
God.

00:10:00:57 - 00:10:01:22
Very

00:10:01:22 - 00:10:01:40
healthy.

00:10:01:40 - 00:10:02:00
Oh,

00:10:02:00 - 00:10:02:15
my

00:10:02:15 - 00:10:02:51
God.

00:10:02:51 - 00:10:03:07
I

00:10:03:07 - 00:10:03:32
know,

00:10:03:32 - 00:10:03:57
I know.

00:10:03:57 - 00:10:04:13
I know.

00:10:04:13 - 00:10:04:26
You're

00:10:04:26 - 00:10:04:57
excited.

00:10:04:57 - 00:10:05:06
I

00:10:05:06 - 00:10:05:31
know.

00:10:06:05 - 00:10:06:18
Okay,

00:10:06:18 - 00:10:06:52
wait.

00:10:06:52 - 00:10:07:31
Okay.

00:10:07:31 - 00:10:07:42
All right,

00:10:07:42 - 00:10:07:49
here

00:10:07:49 - 00:10:08:02
we go.

00:10:08:02 - 00:10:08:07
Here

00:10:08:07 - 00:10:08:40
we go.

00:10:08:51 - 00:10:09:12
All right,

00:10:09:12 - 00:10:09:36
Both

00:10:09:52 - 00:10:10:01
high

00:10:10:01 - 00:10:10:37
five

00:10:10:49 - 00:10:11:02
for

00:10:11:02 - 00:10:11:36
Golden

00:10:11:36 - 00:10:12:05
Boy.

00:10:12:39 - 00:10:12:48
These

00:10:12:48 - 00:10:13:30
fights,

00:10:13:30 - 00:10:13:48
they

00:10:13:48 - 00:10:15:28
come out

00:10:15:28 - 00:10:15:45
okay.

00:10:15:45 - 00:10:15:57
All right,

00:10:15:57 - 00:10:16:04
We're

00:10:16:04 - 00:10:16:30
good.

00:10:16:31 - 00:10:16:42
I

00:10:16:42 - 00:10:17:13
just wake up

00:10:17:13 - 00:10:18:00
nice

00:10:18:16 - 00:10:18:28
when

00:10:18:28 - 00:10:18:45
I think of

00:10:18:45 - 00:10:19:30
the items.

00:10:19:30 - 00:10:19:39
So

00:10:19:39 - 00:10:19:49
I think

00:10:19:49 - 00:10:20:07
cracking

00:10:20:07 - 00:10:20:25
players.

00:10:20:25 - 00:10:20:51
Correct.

00:10:21:50 - 00:10:21:59
I

00:10:21:59 - 00:10:22:10
think

00:10:22:10 - 00:10:22:37
glass

00:10:22:37 - 00:10:23:56
cannon.

00:10:23:58 - 00:10:24:30
Alessandra

00:10:24:30 - 00:10:24:41
is

00:10:24:41 - 00:10:24:59
better

00:10:24:59 - 00:10:25:06
than

00:10:25:06 - 00:10:25:17
ever

00:10:25:17 - 00:10:25:33
from

00:10:25:33 - 00:10:25:51
this game

00:10:25:51 - 00:10:26:04
because

00:10:26:04 - 00:10:26:11
you're

00:10:26:11 - 00:10:26:40
playing

00:10:26:40 - 00:10:27:05
off of

00:10:27:05 - 00:10:27:30
Malfoy.

00:10:27:30 - 00:10:28:03
Ah,

00:10:28:04 - 00:10:29:11
and

00:10:29:11 - 00:10:29:34
you're

00:10:29:34 - 00:10:29:51
playing

00:10:29:51 - 00:10:29:58
with

00:10:29:58 - 00:10:30:16
Kindred.

00:10:30:16 - 00:10:30:46
Ah, so

00:10:30:46 - 00:10:31:03
everyone

00:10:31:03 - 00:10:31:13
else

00:10:31:13 - 00:10:31:19
is

00:10:31:19 - 00:10:32:00
really bad.

00:10:32:00 - 00:10:32:13
And

00:10:32:13 - 00:10:32:20
then

00:10:32:20 - 00:10:32:33
boy,

00:10:32:33 - 00:10:32:45
going

00:10:32:45 - 00:10:33:09
Banshees

00:10:33:09 - 00:10:33:21
Vale

00:10:33:21 - 00:10:33:28
is

00:10:33:28 - 00:10:34:04
also

00:10:34:04 - 00:10:34:30
kind of

00:10:34:30 - 00:10:34:44
bad

00:10:34:44 - 00:10:34:59
because

00:10:34:59 - 00:10:35:22
VI can

00:10:35:22 - 00:10:35:33
just

00:10:35:33 - 00:10:36:12
smite,

00:10:36:12 - 00:10:36:28
she can

00:10:36:28 - 00:10:36:45
press.

00:10:36:45 - 00:10:37:03
Ah,

00:10:37:03 - 00:10:37:08
and

00:10:37:08 - 00:10:37:15
then

00:10:37:15 - 00:10:37:24
she

00:10:37:24 - 00:10:38:11
smiles.

00:10:38:11 - 00:10:38:22
So

00:10:38:22 - 00:10:38:38
Banshees

00:10:38:38 - 00:10:38:49
Vale

00:10:38:49 - 00:10:39:03
doesn't

00:10:39:03 - 00:10:39:14
do

00:10:39:14 - 00:10:39:28
anything,

00:10:39:28 - 00:10:39:33
it

00:10:39:33 - 00:10:39:43
only

00:10:39:43 - 00:10:40:03
blocks

00:10:40:03 - 00:10:40:19
Aria.

00:10:40:19 - 00:10:40:26
It's

00:10:40:26 - 00:10:40:33
just

00:10:40:33 - 00:10:40:49
a very

00:10:40:49 - 00:10:41:06
dumb

00:10:41:06 - 00:10:41:49
item.

00:10:42:10 - 00:10:42:19
So

00:10:42:19 - 00:10:42:34
I think

00:10:42:34 - 00:10:42:48
worries

00:10:42:48 - 00:10:43:19
itemization

00:10:43:19 - 00:10:43:26
is

00:10:43:26 - 00:10:44:42
atrocious.

00:10:44:45 - 00:10:45:10
Likewise,

00:10:45:10 - 00:10:45:23
I think

00:10:45:23 - 00:10:45:38
sticks

00:10:45:38 - 00:10:46:03
say

00:10:46:03 - 00:10:46:21
this is

00:10:46:21 - 00:10:46:24
a

00:10:46:24 - 00:10:46:49
Ronan's

00:10:46:49 - 00:10:47:09
game.

00:10:47:09 - 00:10:47:25
It is

00:10:47:25 - 00:10:47:49
never

00:10:47:49 - 00:10:47:52
a

00:10:47:52 - 00:10:48:10
rapid

00:10:48:10 - 00:10:48:25
fire

00:10:48:25 - 00:10:48:43
cannon

00:10:48:43 - 00:10:49:26
game.

00:10:50:18 - 00:10:50:49
I do

00:10:50:49 - 00:10:50:58
think

00:10:50:58 - 00:10:51:05
that

00:10:51:05 - 00:10:51:25
river

00:10:51:25 - 00:10:51:36
has

00:10:51:36 - 00:10:51:45
good

00:10:51:45 - 00:10:53:04
itemization

00:10:53:04 - 00:10:53:18
so

00:10:53:18 - 00:10:54:01
far.

00:10:54:19 - 00:10:54:34
I think

00:10:54:34 - 00:10:54:55
the

00:10:54:55 - 00:10:55:13
Kraken

00:10:55:13 - 00:10:55:30
player

00:10:55:30 - 00:10:55:39
is

00:10:55:39 - 00:10:55:55
good

00:10:55:55 - 00:10:56:06
that we're

00:10:56:06 - 00:10:56:16
not a

00:10:56:16 - 00:10:56:29
glass.

00:10:56:29 - 00:10:56:38
Having

00:10:56:38 - 00:10:56:40
a

00:10:56:40 - 00:10:56:58
trailer

00:10:56:58 - 00:10:57:12
is is

00:10:57:12 - 00:10:58:03
fine.

00:10:58:22 - 00:10:59:13
I think on

00:10:59:13 - 00:10:59:29
on

00:10:59:29 - 00:11:00:28
elk,

00:11:00:28 - 00:11:00:50
everything

00:11:00:50 - 00:11:00:57
is

00:11:00:57 - 00:11:01:17
actually

00:11:01:17 - 00:11:01:37
fine

00:11:01:37 - 00:11:01:46
on

00:11:01:46 - 00:11:02:29
elk.

00:11:02:51 - 00:11:03:09
I think

00:11:03:09 - 00:11:03:28
Ari

00:11:03:28 - 00:11:03:37
should

00:11:03:37 - 00:11:03:50
also

00:11:03:50 - 00:11:03:55
be

00:11:03:55 - 00:11:04:12
glass

00:11:04:12 - 00:11:05:00
cannon.

00:11:05:00 - 00:11:05:13
She's

00:11:05:13 - 00:11:05:25
like

00:11:05:25 - 00:11:06:07
not

00:11:06:07 - 00:11:06:43
I mean,

00:11:06:43 - 00:11:06:50
she

00:11:06:50 - 00:11:07:01
could

00:11:07:01 - 00:11:07:17
get me

00:11:07:17 - 00:11:07:31
drives

00:11:07:31 - 00:11:07:48
I guess

00:11:07:48 - 00:11:07:58
at this

00:11:07:58 - 00:11:08:29
point.

00:11:08:29 - 00:11:08:51
Nah

00:11:08:51 - 00:11:09:14
is totally

00:11:09:14 - 00:11:09:39
fine

00:11:09:39 - 00:11:09:55
and

00:11:09:55 - 00:11:10:17
VI is

00:11:10:17 - 00:11:10:33
fine

00:11:10:33 - 00:11:10:58
now.

00:11:11:25 - 00:11:11:52
You hate

00:11:11:52 - 00:11:12:01
that

00:11:12:01 - 00:11:12:27
this game

00:11:12:27 - 00:11:12:34
was

00:11:12:34 - 00:11:12:54
actually

00:11:12:54 - 00:11:13:51
winnable

00:11:13:55 - 00:11:14:24
for

00:11:14:24 - 00:11:14:40
Golden

00:11:14:40 - 00:11:15:12
Guardians.

00:11:15:12 - 00:11:15:25
Well,

00:11:15:25 - 00:11:15:37
I mean,

00:11:15:37 - 00:11:15:46
this

00:11:15:46 - 00:11:15:54
is

00:11:15:54 - 00:11:16:19
also a

00:11:16:19 - 00:11:16:42
really

00:11:16:42 - 00:11:17:06
good

00:11:17:06 - 00:11:17:33
argument

00:11:17:33 - 00:11:17:45
about,

00:11:17:45 - 00:11:17:56
like,

00:11:17:56 - 00:11:18:18
draft

00:11:18:18 - 00:11:18:46
importance.

00:11:18:46 - 00:11:18:55
You have

00:11:18:55 - 00:11:19:12
Golden

00:11:19:12 - 00:11:20:02
Guardians

00:11:20:02 - 00:11:20:36
with a

00:11:20:36 - 00:11:21:10
vastly

00:11:21:10 - 00:11:21:41
superior

00:11:21:41 - 00:11:22:35
draft

00:11:22:35 - 00:11:22:53
getting

00:11:22:53 - 00:11:23:15
very

00:11:23:15 - 00:11:23:51
unlucky

00:11:23:51 - 00:11:24:07
and

00:11:24:07 - 00:11:24:14
the

00:11:24:14 - 00:11:24:36
entire

00:11:24:36 - 00:11:24:52
early

00:11:24:52 - 00:11:25:26
stages

00:11:25:26 - 00:11:25:42
like

00:11:25:42 - 00:11:26:00
you

00:11:26:00 - 00:11:26:20
have

00:11:26:20 - 00:11:26:52
basically

00:11:26:52 - 00:11:27:52
as as

00:11:27:52 - 00:11:28:22
worse

00:11:28:22 - 00:11:28:31
of

00:11:28:31 - 00:11:28:51
things

00:11:28:51 - 00:11:29:07
that could

00:11:29:07 - 00:11:29:13
have

00:11:29:13 - 00:11:29:47
possibly

00:11:29:47 - 00:11:30:10
happened,

00:11:30:10 - 00:11:30:52
happen.

00:11:30:52 - 00:11:31:04
And

00:11:31:04 - 00:11:31:21
Golden

00:11:31:21 - 00:11:31:42
Guardians

00:11:31:42 - 00:11:31:48
are

00:11:31:48 - 00:11:31:58
still

00:11:31:58 - 00:11:32:04
in

00:11:32:04 - 00:11:32:07
a

00:11:32:07 - 00:11:32:25
fighting

00:11:32:25 - 00:11:33:10
chance

00:11:33:10 - 00:11:33:16
that

00:11:33:16 - 00:11:33:23
they

00:11:33:23 - 00:11:34:04
have

00:11:34:04 - 00:11:34:30
got is

00:11:34:30 - 00:11:34:49
very,

00:11:34:49 - 00:11:35:02
very,

00:11:35:02 - 00:11:35:18
very

00:11:35:18 - 00:11:35:52
important.

00:11:35:52 - 00:11:36:37
The higher

00:11:36:37 - 00:11:36:46
the

00:11:36:46 - 00:11:37:12
higher

00:11:37:12 - 00:11:37:19
the

00:11:37:19 - 00:11:37:51
gameplay

00:11:37:51 - 00:11:38:15
goes,

00:11:38:15 - 00:11:38:42
the more

00:11:38:42 - 00:11:39:10
important

00:11:39:10 - 00:11:39:32
draft

00:11:39:32 - 00:11:39:46
ends

00:11:39:46 - 00:11:39:54
up

00:11:39:54 - 00:11:40:21
becoming.

00:11:40:21 - 00:11:40:28
And

00:11:40:28 - 00:11:40:35
it's

00:11:40:35 - 00:11:40:49
so

00:11:40:49 - 00:11:41:31
disgusting

00:11:41:31 - 00:11:41:38
that

00:11:41:38 - 00:11:42:00
teams

00:11:42:00 - 00:11:42:19
don't

00:11:42:19 - 00:11:42:46
bother

00:11:42:46 - 00:11:42:57
to

00:11:42:57 - 00:11:43:40
actually

00:11:43:40 - 00:11:44:24
like

00:11:44:25 - 00:11:44:42
add

00:11:44:42 - 00:11:45:18
priority

00:11:45:18 - 00:11:45:57
to it.

00:11:46:04 - 00:11:46:12
You

00:11:46:12 - 00:11:46:17
know,

00:11:46:17 - 00:11:46:22
I've

00:11:46:22 - 00:11:46:37
always

00:11:46:37 - 00:11:46:57
wondered

00:11:46:57 - 00:11:47:45
what would happen

00:11:47:45 - 00:11:47:52
if

00:11:47:52 - 00:11:48:14
riot

00:11:48:14 - 00:11:48:25
just

00:11:48:25 - 00:11:48:36
like

00:11:48:36 - 00:11:48:57
rigged

00:11:48:57 - 00:11:49:26
things

00:11:49:26 - 00:11:49:40
like

00:11:49:40 - 00:11:50:11
actually

00:11:50:11 - 00:11:50:18
and

00:11:50:18 - 00:11:50:34
we would

00:11:50:34 - 00:11:50:52
never

00:11:50:52 - 00:11:51:43
know.

00:11:51:57 - 00:11:52:03
It

00:11:52:03 - 00:11:52:10
was a

00:11:52:10 - 00:11:52:33
professional

00:11:52:33 - 00:11:52:49
tournament

00:11:52:49 - 00:11:52:55
in

00:11:52:55 - 00:11:53:09
South

00:11:53:09 - 00:11:53:45
Korea

00:11:53:45 - 00:11:54:00
where

00:11:54:00 - 00:11:54:16
the best

00:11:54:16 - 00:11:54:28
player

00:11:54:28 - 00:11:54:32
in

00:11:54:32 - 00:11:54:57
the world.

00:11:54:57 - 00:11:55:37
Moon

00:11:55:37 - 00:11:55:53
They were

00:11:55:53 - 00:11:56:13
tired

00:11:56:13 - 00:11:56:25
of them

00:11:56:25 - 00:11:57:00
winning.

00:11:57:00 - 00:11:57:09
So

00:11:57:09 - 00:11:57:54
the mapmakers

00:11:57:54 - 00:11:58:24
actually

00:11:58:24 - 00:11:58:37
went

00:11:58:37 - 00:11:58:55
in and

00:11:58:55 - 00:11:59:20
altered

00:11:59:20 - 00:12:00:00
stats

00:12:00:00 - 00:12:00:46
of the

00:12:00:46 - 00:12:01:10
enemy

00:12:01:10 - 00:12:01:49
races.

00:12:01:49 - 00:12:02:47
Race

00:12:02:47 - 00:12:03:19
against

00:12:03:19 - 00:12:04:13
Moon

00:12:04:31 - 00:12:04:40
in

00:12:04:40 - 00:12:04:51
order

00:12:04:51 - 00:12:04:57
to

00:12:04:57 - 00:12:05:06
make

00:12:05:06 - 00:12:05:18
Moon

00:12:05:18 - 00:12:05:38
Lose,

00:12:05:38 - 00:12:05:54
Moon

00:12:05:54 - 00:12:06:12
won

00:12:06:12 - 00:12:06:37
the match

00:12:06:37 - 00:12:06:43
and

00:12:06:43 - 00:12:06:52
then

00:12:06:52 - 00:12:07:24
pointed out

00:12:07:24 - 00:12:07:31
that

00:12:07:31 - 00:12:07:35
the

00:12:07:35 - 00:12:07:55
stats

00:12:07:55 - 00:12:08:00
were

00:12:08:00 - 00:12:08:47
altered

00:12:08:47 - 00:12:09:03
by

00:12:09:08 - 00:12:10:04
the algae.

00:12:10:04 - 00:12:10:26
He was able

00:12:10:26 - 00:12:10:31
to

00:12:10:31 - 00:12:11:09
tell

00:12:11:09 - 00:12:11:18
no

00:12:11:18 - 00:12:11:58
cigar.

00:12:11:58 - 00:12:12:09
It'd

00:12:12:09 - 00:12:12:30
be like,

00:12:12:30 - 00:12:12:52
Imagine

00:12:12:52 - 00:12:13:01
this,

00:12:13:01 - 00:12:13:17
imagine

00:12:13:17 - 00:12:13:31
this,

00:12:13:33 - 00:12:14:04
Imagine

00:12:14:04 - 00:12:14:22
playing

00:12:14:22 - 00:12:14:40
top

00:12:14:40 - 00:12:15:01
lane

00:12:15:01 - 00:12:15:16
and

00:12:15:16 - 00:12:15:50
the entire

00:12:15:50 - 00:12:16:10
lane

00:12:16:10 - 00:12:16:19
is

00:12:16:19 - 00:12:16:31
just

00:12:16:31 - 00:12:16:46
like

00:12:16:46 - 00:12:16:49
you

00:12:16:49 - 00:12:16:57
want

00:12:16:57 - 00:12:17:18
to try

00:12:17:24 - 00:12:17:56
very

00:12:17:56 - 00:12:18:41
slightly

00:12:18:41 - 00:12:19:03
placed

00:12:19:03 - 00:12:19:30
brushes

00:12:19:30 - 00:12:19:35
and

00:12:19:35 - 00:12:19:40
you

00:12:19:40 - 00:12:19:49
have

00:12:19:49 - 00:12:19:55
to

00:12:19:55 - 00:12:20:06
lean

00:12:20:06 - 00:12:20:20
against

00:12:20:20 - 00:12:20:43
ringer.

00:12:22:33 - 00:12:23:09
Like

00:12:23:16 - 00:12:24:00
imagine

00:12:24:00 - 00:12:24:57
Ringer.

00:12:24:57 - 00:12:25:31
Imagine

00:12:25:31 - 00:12:26:07
the entire

00:12:26:07 - 00:12:26:25
summoner

00:12:26:25 - 00:12:26:40
drift

00:12:26:40 - 00:12:27:07
map is

00:12:27:07 - 00:12:27:16
just

00:12:27:16 - 00:12:27:43
littered

00:12:27:43 - 00:12:27:54
with

00:12:27:54 - 00:12:28:26
brushes

00:12:28:26 - 00:12:28:35
and

00:12:28:35 - 00:12:28:53
Ringer

00:12:28:53 - 00:12:29:13
doesn't

00:12:29:13 - 00:12:29:24
have

00:12:29:24 - 00:12:29:29
to

00:12:29:29 - 00:12:29:42
take

00:12:29:42 - 00:12:30:30
flowers

00:12:30:30 - 00:12:31:01
like

00:12:31:01 - 00:12:31:08
him,

00:12:31:08 - 00:12:31:13
at

00:12:31:13 - 00:12:31:53
least

00:12:32:43 - 00:12:32:49
be

00:12:32:49 - 00:12:33:07
killing

00:12:33:07 - 00:12:33:18
him.

00:12:33:54 - 00:12:34:21
So

00:12:34:21 - 00:12:36:18
my job

00:12:36:28 - 00:12:36:56
is

00:12:37:03 - 00:12:37:10
from

00:12:37:10 - 00:12:37:30
the base

00:12:37:30 - 00:12:37:39
that's

00:12:37:39 - 00:12:37:48
going

00:12:37:48 - 00:12:38:02
to be

00:12:38:02 - 00:12:38:27
Oh,

00:12:38:27 - 00:12:39:18
Jesus.

00:12:39:18 - 00:12:39:28
Back

00:12:39:28 - 00:12:41:04
in the air.

00:12:41:04 - 00:12:41:18
We go,

00:12:41:18 - 00:12:41:42
We go,

00:12:41:42 - 00:12:42:27
We go

00:12:42:27 - 00:12:42:38
off

00:12:42:38 - 00:12:42:55
that,

00:12:43:08 - 00:12:43:26
Oh,

00:12:43:26 - 00:12:43:37
my

00:12:43:37 - 00:12:43:57
God,

00:12:43:57 - 00:12:44:50
dude,

00:12:44:50 - 00:12:45:22
Monaco.

00:12:45:22 - 00:12:45:32
But

00:12:45:32 - 00:12:45:43
who's

00:12:45:43 - 00:12:45:50
going

00:12:45:50 - 00:12:46:04
to be.

00:12:46:13 - 00:12:46:42
Oh,

00:12:46:42 - 00:12:46:49
they

00:12:46:49 - 00:12:47:06
get

00:12:47:13 - 00:12:47:58
Oh,

00:12:47:58 - 00:12:48:23
Sean,

00:12:48:23 - 00:12:48:50
they will

00:12:48:50 - 00:12:49:10
see if

00:12:49:10 - 00:12:49:30
l can

00:12:49:30 - 00:12:49:46
just.

00:12:49:46 - 00:12:50:29
Oh,

00:12:50:31 - 00:12:50:42
but

00:12:50:42 - 00:12:51:01
Alex

00:12:51:01 - 00:12:51:16
is not

00:12:51:16 - 00:12:51:34
in any

00:12:51:34 - 00:12:52:13
threat.

00:12:52:13 - 00:12:52:31
Oh,

00:12:52:31 - 00:12:52:44
my.

00:12:52:44 - 00:12:54:10
No.

00:12:54:10 - 00:12:55:40
All down.

00:12:55:40 - 00:12:55:55
I did

00:12:55:55 - 00:12:56:16
all the

00:12:56:16 - 00:12:57:14
betting.

00:12:57:30 - 00:12:57:52
Oh,

00:12:57:52 - 00:12:58:10
Ben

00:12:58:10 - 00:12:58:37
threw

00:12:58:37 - 00:12:58:48
them

00:12:58:48 - 00:12:59:02
into

00:12:59:02 - 00:12:59:07
the

00:12:59:07 - 00:12:59:22
bin,

00:12:59:22 - 00:12:59:47
man.

00:12:59:47 - 00:13:00:19
Oh,

00:13:00:19 - 00:13:00:48
my

00:13:00:48 - 00:13:02:07
God.

00:13:02:07 - 00:13:02:11
I'm

00:13:02:11 - 00:13:02:25
back.

00:13:02:25 - 00:13:02:31
And

00:13:02:31 - 00:13:02:54
thing

00:13:02:54 - 00:13:03:12
picks

00:13:03:12 - 00:13:03:18
up

00:13:03:18 - 00:13:03:21
a

00:13:03:21 - 00:13:03:45
triple

00:13:03:45 - 00:13:04:17
kill.

00:13:04:17 - 00:13:04:31
Oh,

00:13:04:31 - 00:13:04:40
it's

00:13:04:40 - 00:13:04:55
over.

00:13:04:55 - 00:13:05:00
It's

00:13:05:00 - 00:13:05:29
over.

00:13:05:31 - 00:13:05:38
One

00:13:05:38 - 00:13:05:51
left

00:13:05:51 - 00:13:06:14
standing,

00:13:06:14 - 00:13:06:37
Baron.

00:13:06:37 - 00:13:06:55
Still

00:13:06:55 - 00:13:07:15
good

00:13:07:15 - 00:13:07:31
for

00:13:07:31 - 00:13:08:25
PLG.

00:13:08:25 - 00:13:08:33
And

00:13:08:33 - 00:13:08:40
there's

00:13:08:40 - 00:13:08:47
going

00:13:08:47 - 00:13:08:54
to be

00:13:08:54 - 00:13:08:58
a

00:13:08:58 - 00:13:09:16
clean

00:13:09:16 - 00:13:09:23
up

00:13:09:23 - 00:13:09:34
the.

00:13:09:48 - 00:13:10:57
Oh,

00:13:10:57 - 00:13:11:40
that was close.

00:13:11:40 - 00:13:12:39
That was close.

00:13:12:39 - 00:13:13:19
Wow,

00:13:13:19 - 00:13:13:31
that's

00:13:13:31 - 00:13:14:18
close,

00:13:14:38 - 00:13:14:52
dude.

00:13:14:52 - 00:13:15:23
Honestly,

00:13:15:23 - 00:13:15:36
what

00:13:15:36 - 00:13:15:59
a close

00:13:15:59 - 00:13:16:15
game,

00:13:16:15 - 00:13:16:37
though.

00:13:16:37 - 00:13:16:49
They're

00:13:16:49 - 00:13:17:18
scaling.

00:13:17:18 - 00:13:17:56
Really,

00:13:17:56 - 00:13:18:12
really,

00:13:18:12 - 00:13:18:28
really

00:13:18:28 - 00:13:19:03
help.

00:13:19:09 - 00:13:19:33
It was

00:13:19:33 - 00:13:19:51
scaling

00:13:19:51 - 00:13:20:24
legitimately

00:13:20:24 - 00:13:20:33
did

00:13:20:33 - 00:13:20:47
help,

00:13:20:47 - 00:13:21:23
but oh

00:13:21:23 - 00:13:21:52
my God

00:13:21:52 - 00:13:22:19
got the last

00:13:22:19 - 00:13:22:48
kill

00:13:22:48 - 00:13:23:11
I have

00:13:23:11 - 00:13:24:19
I via

00:13:24:19 - 00:13:25:13
recon.

00:13:25:13 - 00:13:25:28
So

00:13:25:28 - 00:13:25:48
again

00:13:25:48 - 00:13:26:02
Golden

00:13:26:02 - 00:13:26:20
Guardians

00:13:26:20 - 00:13:26:36
actually

00:13:26:36 - 00:13:26:52
starting

00:13:26:52 - 00:13:27:01
off

00:13:27:01 - 00:13:27:34
with a

00:13:27:34 - 00:13:28:08
okay

00:13:28:08 - 00:13:28:31
draft

00:13:28:31 - 00:13:29:06
edge.

00:13:29:06 - 00:13:29:20
I think

00:13:29:20 - 00:13:29:27
it's

00:13:29:27 - 00:13:29:42
easier

00:13:29:42 - 00:13:29:47
to

00:13:29:47 - 00:13:30:00
pile

00:13:30:00 - 00:13:30:14
Golden

00:13:30:14 - 00:13:30:34
Guardians

00:13:30:34 - 00:13:30:50
dropped

00:13:30:50 - 00:13:30:59
than

00:13:30:59 - 00:13:31:42
it is

00:13:31:42 - 00:13:31:48
to

00:13:31:48 - 00:13:31:58
plow

00:13:31:58 - 00:13:32:29
builds

00:13:32:29 - 00:13:32:40
from

00:13:32:40 - 00:13:33:16
this

00:13:33:16 - 00:13:33:25
from

00:13:33:25 - 00:13:33:32
this

00:13:33:32 - 00:13:33:41
point

00:13:33:41 - 00:13:33:48
in the

00:13:33:48 - 00:13:34:22
draft

00:13:34:22 - 00:13:34:42
Jinx

00:13:34:42 - 00:13:34:49
and

00:13:34:49 - 00:13:35:06
Lulu

00:13:35:06 - 00:13:35:15
now

00:13:35:15 - 00:13:35:27
picked

00:13:35:27 - 00:13:35:40
up

00:13:35:40 - 00:13:35:56
that

00:13:35:56 - 00:13:36:09
same

00:13:36:09 - 00:13:36:23
nice

00:13:36:23 - 00:13:36:57
response

00:13:36:57 - 00:13:37:03
and

00:13:37:03 - 00:13:37:10
now

00:13:37:10 - 00:13:37:24
it gives

00:13:37:24 - 00:13:37:28
the

00:13:37:28 - 00:13:37:51
opportunity

00:13:37:51 - 00:13:37:58
for

00:13:37:58 - 00:13:38:11
golden

00:13:38:11 - 00:13:38:33
audience

00:13:38:33 - 00:13:38:49
to

00:13:38:49 - 00:13:39:20
to to,

00:13:39:20 - 00:13:39:32
to

00:13:39:32 - 00:13:39:50
throw

00:13:39:50 - 00:13:40:12
it.

00:13:40:57 - 00:13:41:06
And

00:13:41:06 - 00:13:41:22
I think

00:13:41:22 - 00:13:41:43
Asante

00:13:41:43 - 00:13:41:44
auntie

00:13:41:44 - 00:13:42:00
is

00:13:42:00 - 00:13:42:43
throwing it

00:13:42:43 - 00:13:42:59
because

00:13:42:59 - 00:13:43:12
now

00:13:43:12 - 00:13:43:26
I think

00:13:43:26 - 00:13:43:30
you

00:13:43:30 - 00:13:43:55
get access

00:13:43:55 - 00:13:44:00
to

00:13:44:00 - 00:13:44:09
like

00:13:44:09 - 00:13:44:51
Gwen.

00:13:44:51 - 00:13:45:01
So

00:13:45:01 - 00:13:45:18
if you're

00:13:45:18 - 00:13:45:25
going

00:13:45:25 - 00:13:45:34
to get

00:13:45:34 - 00:13:45:54
burned away

00:13:45:54 - 00:13:46:01
and

00:13:46:01 - 00:13:46:12
maybe

00:13:46:12 - 00:13:46:35
Gwen's

00:13:46:35 - 00:13:46:42
going

00:13:46:42 - 00:13:46:53
to get

00:13:46:53 - 00:13:47:06
banned,

00:13:47:06 - 00:13:47:36
okay,

00:13:47:36 - 00:13:47:56
Now

00:13:47:56 - 00:13:48:08
the

00:13:48:09 - 00:13:48:34
Asante

00:13:48:34 - 00:13:48:46
is

00:13:48:46 - 00:13:49:12
a dual

00:13:49:12 - 00:13:49:42
flex,

00:13:49:42 - 00:13:49:51
but

00:13:49:51 - 00:13:50:13
still

00:13:50:13 - 00:13:50:33
Gwen

00:13:50:33 - 00:13:50:49
can

00:13:50:49 - 00:13:51:03
even

00:13:51:03 - 00:13:51:10
be

00:13:51:10 - 00:13:51:25
moved

00:13:51:25 - 00:13:52:22
into midline.

00:13:52:22 - 00:13:53:11
So I

00:13:53:11 - 00:13:53:33
do think

00:13:53:33 - 00:13:53:40
that

00:13:53:40 - 00:13:53:51
because

00:13:53:51 - 00:13:54:03
Auntie

00:13:54:03 - 00:13:54:34
does

00:13:54:34 - 00:13:54:46
throw

00:13:54:46 - 00:13:54:52
the

00:13:54:52 - 00:13:55:08
draft

00:13:55:08 - 00:13:55:17
away

00:13:55:17 - 00:13:56:04
a little bit,

00:13:56:36 - 00:13:57:05
this is also

00:13:57:05 - 00:13:57:10
the

00:13:57:10 - 00:13:57:41
problem

00:13:57:41 - 00:13:58:28
with

00:13:58:37 - 00:13:59:02
taking

00:13:59:02 - 00:13:59:06
the

00:13:59:06 - 00:13:59:31
recon

00:13:59:31 - 00:14:00:09
immediately.

00:14:01:28 - 00:14:01:46
Because

00:14:01:46 - 00:14:02:04
if

00:14:02:04 - 00:14:02:11
they

00:14:02:11 - 00:14:02:20
did

00:14:02:20 - 00:14:02:51
Cassandra

00:14:02:51 - 00:14:03:52
on R2

00:14:03:52 - 00:14:04:03
and

00:14:04:03 - 00:14:04:10
then

00:14:04:10 - 00:14:04:35
waited

00:14:04:35 - 00:14:04:45
for

00:14:04:45 - 00:14:05:29
recon,

00:14:05:29 - 00:14:05:52
they could have

00:14:05:52 - 00:14:06:09
actually

00:14:06:09 - 00:14:06:23
gotten

00:14:06:23 - 00:14:07:24
sonar

00:14:07:40 - 00:14:08:00
instead

00:14:08:00 - 00:14:08:07
of

00:14:08:07 - 00:14:09:23
recon,

00:14:09:41 - 00:14:09:52
and

00:14:09:52 - 00:14:10:06
that would

00:14:10:06 - 00:14:10:26
be

00:14:10:26 - 00:14:10:39
much

00:14:10:39 - 00:14:10:53
harder

00:14:10:53 - 00:14:11:13
scaling

00:14:11:13 - 00:14:11:49
into the lulu

00:14:11:49 - 00:14:11:54
and

00:14:11:54 - 00:14:12:12
that would be

00:14:12:12 - 00:14:12:27
a lot

00:14:12:27 - 00:14:13:06
better.

00:14:14:20 - 00:14:14:31
But

00:14:14:31 - 00:14:14:43
because

00:14:14:43 - 00:14:15:01
of the

00:14:15:01 - 00:14:15:25
the

00:14:15:25 - 00:14:15:34
the

00:14:15:34 - 00:14:15:57
draft

00:14:15:57 - 00:14:16:15
order,

00:14:16:15 - 00:14:16:26
now

00:14:16:26 - 00:14:17:20
you can argue

00:14:17:20 - 00:14:17:38
maybe

00:14:17:38 - 00:14:17:45
that

00:14:17:45 - 00:14:18:00
drinks

00:14:18:00 - 00:14:18:14
Lulu

00:14:18:14 - 00:14:18:32
wouldn't

00:14:18:32 - 00:14:18:39
be

00:14:18:39 - 00:14:19:30
picked.

00:14:19:44 - 00:14:19:53
But

00:14:19:53 - 00:14:20:13
I think

00:14:20:13 - 00:14:20:18
that

00:14:20:18 - 00:14:20:24
it

00:14:20:24 - 00:14:20:51
would.

00:14:20:51 - 00:14:21:09
I think

00:14:21:09 - 00:14:21:16
that

00:14:21:16 - 00:14:21:45
I think

00:14:21:45 - 00:14:21:50
that

00:14:21:50 - 00:14:21:54
it

00:14:21:54 - 00:14:22:13
would

00:14:22:13 - 00:14:22:48
like

00:14:22:48 - 00:14:23:06
nine

00:14:23:06 - 00:14:23:20
times

00:14:23:20 - 00:14:23:31
out of

00:14:23:31 - 00:14:24:14
ten.

00:14:24:21 - 00:14:24:50
Alternatively,

00:14:24:50 - 00:14:25:04
it would be

00:14:25:04 - 00:14:25:26
like

00:14:25:30 - 00:14:25:57
Jinx

00:14:25:57 - 00:14:26:29
Thresh,

00:14:26:29 - 00:14:26:36
but

00:14:26:36 - 00:14:26:45
then

00:14:26:45 - 00:14:26:49
you

00:14:26:49 - 00:14:26:56
would

00:14:26:56 - 00:14:27:03
get

00:14:27:03 - 00:14:27:21
access

00:14:27:21 - 00:14:27:27
to

00:14:27:27 - 00:14:27:36
like

00:14:27:36 - 00:14:27:50
Blitz

00:14:27:50 - 00:14:28:30
Crank.

00:14:28:55 - 00:14:29:06
So

00:14:29:06 - 00:14:29:31
like

00:14:29:42 - 00:14:29:51
no

00:14:29:51 - 00:14:30:01
matter

00:14:30:01 - 00:14:30:23
what,

00:14:30:23 - 00:14:30:37
just

00:14:30:37 - 00:14:30:50
going

00:14:30:50 - 00:14:30:57
are

00:14:30:57 - 00:14:31:04
one

00:14:31:04 - 00:14:31:12
hour

00:14:31:12 - 00:14:31:30
twos

00:14:31:30 - 00:14:31:35
I

00:14:31:35 - 00:14:31:57
recon

00:14:31:57 - 00:14:32:00
I

00:14:32:00 - 00:14:32:07
think

00:14:32:07 - 00:14:32:13
is

00:14:32:13 - 00:14:32:22
just

00:14:32:22 - 00:14:32:36
really

00:14:32:36 - 00:14:33:10
bad

00:14:33:10 - 00:14:33:23
if

00:14:33:23 - 00:14:33:28
you're

00:14:33:28 - 00:14:33:43
willing

00:14:33:43 - 00:14:33:48
to

00:14:33:48 - 00:14:34:17
like

00:14:34:33 - 00:14:34:48
you know

00:14:34:48 - 00:14:35:12
multi-role

00:14:35:12 - 00:14:35:33
flacks

00:14:35:33 - 00:14:35:47
the

00:14:35:47 - 00:14:36:00
because

00:14:36:00 - 00:14:36:34
Auntie

00:14:36:34 - 00:14:37:12
Ari in

00:14:37:12 - 00:14:37:46
NA do

00:14:37:46 - 00:14:37:55
this

00:14:37:55 - 00:14:38:11
draft

00:14:38:11 - 00:14:38:24
so

00:14:38:24 - 00:14:38:52
bland

00:14:38:52 - 00:14:39:09
it's

00:14:39:09 - 00:14:39:25
so

00:14:39:25 - 00:14:39:54
bland

00:14:39:54 - 00:14:40:17
now

00:14:40:17 - 00:14:40:51
in theory

00:14:40:51 - 00:14:41:18
the Gorgas

00:14:41:18 - 00:14:41:25
could

00:14:41:25 - 00:14:41:38
also

00:14:41:38 - 00:14:41:47
just

00:14:41:47 - 00:14:41:56
go

00:14:41:56 - 00:14:42:16
jungle

00:14:42:16 - 00:14:42:45
here

00:14:42:50 - 00:14:43:10
so

00:14:43:10 - 00:14:43:42
you could

00:14:43:42 - 00:14:44:13
go

00:14:44:13 - 00:14:44:54
gorgeous.

00:14:44:54 - 00:14:45:12
Oh

00:14:45:12 - 00:14:45:48
my God.

00:14:45:48 - 00:14:46:06
Oh

00:14:46:06 - 00:14:46:28
my God.

00:14:46:28 - 00:14:46:31
It

00:14:46:31 - 00:14:46:40
was.

00:14:46:40 - 00:14:46:57
I was

00:14:46:57 - 00:14:47:11
trying

00:14:47:11 - 00:14:47:25
to get

00:14:47:25 - 00:14:47:43
to it.

00:14:47:43 - 00:14:48:48
Wow.

00:14:48:50 - 00:14:49:44
Yes.

00:14:49:44 - 00:14:50:06
Golden

00:14:50:06 - 00:14:50:38
Guardians.

00:14:50:38 - 00:14:51:09
Very,

00:14:51:09 - 00:14:51:27
very,

00:14:51:27 - 00:14:51:43
very,

00:14:51:43 - 00:14:52:00
very

00:14:52:00 - 00:14:52:39
good.

00:14:53:04 - 00:14:53:36
You could

00:14:53:36 - 00:14:54:03
go

00:14:54:03 - 00:14:54:41
groggy

00:14:54:41 - 00:14:55:26
Yasuo

00:14:55:26 - 00:14:55:35
and

00:14:55:35 - 00:14:55:42
it's

00:14:55:42 - 00:14:56:09
gory

00:14:56:09 - 00:14:56:22
on

00:14:56:22 - 00:14:56:52
Yasuo.

00:14:56:52 - 00:14:57:05
This

00:14:57:05 - 00:14:57:19
can

00:14:57:19 - 00:14:57:57
actually

00:14:57:57 - 00:14:58:19
work,

00:14:58:19 - 00:14:59:24
guys.

00:14:59:45 - 00:15:00:28
Oh, my

00:15:00:28 - 00:15:01:51
Lord.

00:15:01:53 - 00:15:02:06
All right,

00:15:02:06 - 00:15:02:13
here

00:15:02:13 - 00:15:02:24
we go.

00:15:02:24 - 00:15:02:31
Here

00:15:02:31 - 00:15:03:03
we go.

00:15:03:03 - 00:15:03:25
So

00:15:03:25 - 00:15:03:55
I do think

00:15:03:55 - 00:15:04:12
that

00:15:04:12 - 00:15:04:28
Golden

00:15:04:28 - 00:15:05:33
Guardians,

00:15:05:33 - 00:15:05:49
I think

00:15:05:49 - 00:15:06:00
they have

00:15:06:00 - 00:15:06:01
a

00:15:06:01 - 00:15:06:12
better

00:15:06:12 - 00:15:06:36
draft

00:15:06:36 - 00:15:07:24
again,

00:15:07:24 - 00:15:07:48
which is

00:15:07:48 - 00:15:08:20
very good

00:15:08:20 - 00:15:08:47
news

00:15:08:47 - 00:15:09:21
if you are

00:15:09:21 - 00:15:09:59
an American

00:15:09:59 - 00:15:10:40
fan.

00:15:10:40 - 00:15:11:06
But

00:15:11:06 - 00:15:11:25
then

00:15:11:25 - 00:15:11:29
you

00:15:11:29 - 00:15:11:52
remember

00:15:11:52 - 00:15:12:00
that

00:15:12:00 - 00:15:12:07
it's

00:15:12:07 - 00:15:12:14
the

00:15:12:14 - 00:15:12:34
LPL

00:15:12:34 - 00:15:12:50
second

00:15:12:50 - 00:15:13:15
seed

00:15:13:15 - 00:15:14:16
and,

00:15:14:16 - 00:15:14:24
you

00:15:14:24 - 00:15:14:56
know,

00:15:15:10 - 00:15:15:21
I'm

00:15:15:21 - 00:15:15:34
not

00:15:15:34 - 00:15:15:43
sure

00:15:15:43 - 00:15:15:48
if

00:15:15:48 - 00:15:16:01
Golden

00:15:16:01 - 00:15:16:28
Guardians

00:15:16:28 - 00:15:16:40
are

00:15:16:40 - 00:15:16:49
going

00:15:16:49 - 00:15:16:58
to be

00:15:16:58 - 00:15:17:09
able

00:15:17:09 - 00:15:17:29
to

00:15:17:29 - 00:15:17:42
hold

00:15:17:42 - 00:15:17:45
it

00:15:17:45 - 00:15:18:07
together.

00:15:20:09 - 00:15:20:52
True.

00:15:20:52 - 00:15:21:07
Okay.

00:15:21:07 - 00:15:21:43
Okay.

00:15:22:26 - 00:15:23:20
Laurie,

00:15:24:05 - 00:15:24:10
I

00:15:24:10 - 00:15:24:27
don't.

00:15:24:27 - 00:15:24:52
Okay.

00:15:24:52 - 00:15:25:06
Or is

00:15:25:06 - 00:15:25:13
going

00:15:25:13 - 00:15:25:17
to

00:15:25:17 - 00:15:25:37
lose a

00:15:25:37 - 00:15:25:46
little

00:15:25:46 - 00:15:26:05
bit of

00:15:26:06 - 00:15:26:16
me.

00:15:26:16 - 00:15:26:24
It's

00:15:26:24 - 00:15:26:31
going

00:15:26:31 - 00:15:26:38
to be

00:15:26:38 - 00:15:26:54
fine,

00:15:26:54 - 00:15:27:01
though.

00:15:27:01 - 00:15:27:07
It's

00:15:27:07 - 00:15:27:16
got to

00:15:27:16 - 00:15:27:19
be

00:15:27:19 - 00:15:27:32
funny.

00:15:27:32 - 00:15:27:36
A

00:15:27:36 - 00:15:27:52
second

00:15:27:52 - 00:15:28:04
wind

00:15:28:04 - 00:15:28:10
here,

00:15:28:10 - 00:15:28:24
second

00:15:28:24 - 00:15:28:31
wind

00:15:28:31 - 00:15:29:40
overgrowth,

00:15:30:03 - 00:15:30:23
actually

00:15:30:23 - 00:15:30:28
a

00:15:30:28 - 00:15:30:39
little

00:15:30:39 - 00:15:30:46
bit

00:15:30:46 - 00:15:31:30
curious

00:15:31:30 - 00:15:32:56
why

00:15:33:10 - 00:15:34:01
he.

00:15:34:03 - 00:15:34:19
Yeah,

00:15:34:19 - 00:15:34:22
I

00:15:34:22 - 00:15:34:33
don't

00:15:34:33 - 00:15:35:09
know.

00:15:35:09 - 00:15:35:25
Second,

00:15:35:25 - 00:15:35:27
I

00:15:35:27 - 00:15:35:36
wouldn't

00:15:35:36 - 00:15:36:05
necessarily

00:15:36:05 - 00:15:36:10
in

00:15:36:10 - 00:15:36:19
this

00:15:36:19 - 00:15:36:59
lane

00:15:37:10 - 00:15:37:33
behind

00:15:37:33 - 00:15:37:58
them

00:15:38:07 - 00:15:38:22
maybe

00:15:38:22 - 00:15:39:03
it is

00:15:39:03 - 00:15:39:23
a one

00:15:39:23 - 00:15:39:45
from

00:15:39:48 - 00:15:40:03
maybe

00:15:40:03 - 00:15:40:17
it is.

00:15:40:17 - 00:15:40:30
Maybe

00:15:40:30 - 00:15:41:04
it as

00:15:41:04 - 00:15:41:18
well.

00:15:41:18 - 00:15:41:25
We've

00:15:41:25 - 00:15:41:42
seen it

00:15:41:42 - 00:15:41:58
so

00:15:41:58 - 00:15:42:09
many

00:15:42:09 - 00:15:42:16
times.

00:15:42:16 - 00:15:42:28
I'm

00:15:42:28 - 00:15:42:37
not

00:15:42:37 - 00:15:43:21
sure.

00:15:43:22 - 00:15:43:49
Oh

00:15:43:49 - 00:15:44:33
okay.

00:15:44:33 - 00:15:44:45
I'm

00:15:44:45 - 00:15:44:52
not

00:15:44:52 - 00:15:45:00
sure.

00:15:45:00 - 00:15:45:05
I'm

00:15:45:05 - 00:15:45:12
not

00:15:45:12 - 00:15:45:36
sure.

00:15:45:36 - 00:15:46:13
Okay.

00:15:46:13 - 00:15:46:26
That's

00:15:46:26 - 00:15:46:44
the thing.

00:15:46:44 - 00:15:46:55
They're there.

00:15:47:15 - 00:15:47:29
All right,

00:15:47:29 - 00:15:47:34
here

00:15:47:34 - 00:15:48:16
we go.

00:15:48:16 - 00:15:48:52
Go Spy

00:15:48:52 - 00:15:49:04
Six,

00:15:49:04 - 00:15:49:19
eight.

00:15:49:19 - 00:15:49:33
Going

00:15:49:33 - 00:15:49:40

00:15:49:46 - 00:15:50:09
Elk.

00:15:50:09 - 00:15:50:36
Elk

00:15:50:36 - 00:15:51:00
standing

00:15:51:00 - 00:15:51:07
is

00:15:51:07 - 00:15:51:16
great

00:15:51:16 - 00:15:51:27
way

00:15:51:27 - 00:15:51:41
elk

00:15:51:41 - 00:15:51:55
actually

00:15:51:55 - 00:15:52:04
does

00:15:52:04 - 00:15:52:17
not

00:15:52:17 - 00:15:52:31
seem

00:15:52:31 - 00:15:53:34
to be aware.

00:15:53:34 - 00:15:53:43
Try

00:15:53:43 - 00:15:53:58
to see

00:15:53:58 - 00:15:54:03
if

00:15:54:03 - 00:15:54:12
you can

00:15:54:12 - 00:15:54:34
maybe

00:15:54:43 - 00:15:54:55
wait.

00:15:54:55 - 00:15:55:03
Oh,

00:15:55:03 - 00:15:55:08
my

00:15:55:08 - 00:15:55:17
God.

00:15:55:17 - 00:15:55:28
Never

00:15:55:28 - 00:15:55:39
mind.

00:15:55:39 - 00:15:55:54
Six

00:15:55:54 - 00:15:56:02
days.

00:15:56:02 - 00:15:56:18
Not

00:15:56:18 - 00:15:59:16
a06.

00:15:59:16 - 00:15:59:22
He

00:15:59:22 - 00:15:59:34
thought

00:15:59:34 - 00:16:00:00
he could do

00:16:00:00 - 00:16:00:12
it.

00:16:00:12 - 00:16:00:23
And

00:16:00:23 - 00:16:00:36
now

00:16:00:36 - 00:16:00:45
you

00:16:00:45 - 00:16:00:57
go.

00:16:00:57 - 00:16:01:12
Who?

00:16:01:12 - 00:16:01:40
He has

00:16:01:40 - 00:16:02:02
nowhere

00:16:02:02 - 00:16:02:42
to be.

00:16:02:42 - 00:16:03:05
Nowhere

00:16:03:05 - 00:16:03:50
to go.

00:16:03:50 - 00:16:04:13
One

00:16:04:13 - 00:16:04:34
more

00:16:04:34 - 00:16:04:50
auto

00:16:04:50 - 00:16:05:16
attack

00:16:05:16 - 00:16:05:22
and

00:16:05:22 - 00:16:05:29
it's

00:16:05:29 - 00:16:05:40
going

00:16:05:40 - 00:16:06:19
to be out

00:16:06:19 - 00:16:06:57
just about.

00:16:06:57 - 00:16:07:49
Never mind

00:16:07:49 - 00:16:08:02
on

00:16:08:02 - 00:16:08:24
says

00:16:08:24 - 00:16:08:40
that's

00:16:08:40 - 00:16:09:34
Michael,

00:16:09:34 - 00:16:09:50
what

00:16:09:50 - 00:16:10:12
looked

00:16:10:12 - 00:16:10:24
like

00:16:10:24 - 00:16:10:48
Golden

00:16:10:48 - 00:16:11:16
Guardians

00:16:11:16 - 00:16:11:34
having

00:16:11:34 - 00:16:11:38
a

00:16:11:38 - 00:16:12:12
unique

00:16:12:12 - 00:16:13:12
set of

00:16:13:12 - 00:16:14:00
disaster

00:16:14:00 - 00:16:14:22
belts.

00:16:14:22 - 00:16:14:27
You

00:16:14:27 - 00:16:14:38
get

00:16:14:38 - 00:16:15:03
two

00:16:15:03 - 00:16:15:41
guys

00:16:15:41 - 00:16:16:26
I think

00:16:16:26 - 00:16:16:40
that

00:16:16:40 - 00:16:17:07
drinks

00:16:17:07 - 00:16:17:20
with

00:16:17:20 - 00:16:18:14
call

00:16:18:16 - 00:16:19:10
starting

00:16:19:10 - 00:16:19:33
I think

00:16:19:33 - 00:16:19:48
drinks

00:16:19:48 - 00:16:19:58
with

00:16:19:58 - 00:16:20:20
calls,

00:16:20:20 - 00:16:20:43
starting

00:16:20:43 - 00:16:21:07
with

00:16:21:07 - 00:16:21:25
first

00:16:21:25 - 00:16:21:45
blood

00:16:21:45 - 00:16:22:33
and,

00:16:22:33 - 00:16:22:42
you

00:16:22:42 - 00:16:22:53
know,

00:16:22:53 - 00:16:23:43
assists.

00:16:23:43 - 00:16:24:01
I think

00:16:24:01 - 00:16:24:07
the

00:16:24:07 - 00:16:24:21
game's

00:16:24:21 - 00:16:24:34
over,

00:16:24:34 - 00:16:25:17
guys.

00:16:25:28 - 00:16:25:37
I

00:16:25:37 - 00:16:26:09
think,

00:16:26:16 - 00:16:26:22
you

00:16:26:22 - 00:16:26:31
know

00:16:26:31 - 00:16:26:34
I

00:16:26:34 - 00:16:26:43
mean,

00:16:26:43 - 00:16:27:09
I think

00:16:27:09 - 00:16:27:28
I think

00:16:27:28 - 00:16:27:36
that

00:16:27:36 - 00:16:27:50
Golden

00:16:27:50 - 00:16:28:12
Guardians

00:16:28:12 - 00:16:28:24
fought

00:16:28:24 - 00:16:29:29
valiantly

00:16:29:29 - 00:16:29:36
that

00:16:29:36 - 00:16:29:58
there

00:16:30:10 - 00:16:30:32
we are

00:16:30:32 - 00:16:30:42
2

00:16:30:42 - 00:16:30:52
minutes

00:16:30:52 - 00:16:31:13
and 30

00:16:31:13 - 00:16:31:30
seconds

00:16:31:30 - 00:16:32:40
in the game.

00:16:32:40 - 00:16:32:52
I mean

00:16:32:52 - 00:16:33:00
it's

00:16:33:00 - 00:16:33:16
actually

00:16:33:16 - 00:16:33:57
crazy

00:16:33:57 - 00:16:34:15
that

00:16:34:15 - 00:16:34:44
Alcan

00:16:34:44 - 00:16:35:22
on new

00:16:35:22 - 00:16:35:49
the

00:16:35:49 - 00:16:36:09
the

00:16:36:09 - 00:16:36:23
limit

00:16:36:23 - 00:16:36:41
range

00:16:36:41 - 00:16:36:59
actually

00:16:36:59 - 00:16:37:13
a lot

00:16:37:13 - 00:16:37:49
better

00:16:38:22 - 00:16:38:34
but

00:16:38:34 - 00:16:39:57
also

00:16:39:57 - 00:16:40:22
I mean

00:16:40:22 - 00:16:40:35
I

00:16:40:35 - 00:16:40:53
guess

00:16:40:53 - 00:16:41:34
686,

00:16:41:34 - 00:16:41:43
eight

00:16:41:43 - 00:16:41:49
and

00:16:41:49 - 00:16:42:03
we should

00:16:42:03 - 00:16:42:12
go

00:16:42:12 - 00:16:42:27
he'll

00:16:42:27 - 00:16:42:46
ignite

00:16:42:46 - 00:16:42:52
if

00:16:42:52 - 00:16:42:59
they're

00:16:42:59 - 00:16:43:06
going

00:16:43:06 - 00:16:43:15
to do

00:16:43:15 - 00:16:43:35
something

00:16:43:35 - 00:16:43:44
like

00:16:43:44 - 00:16:43:52
this.

00:16:43:52 - 00:16:43:55
It

00:16:43:55 - 00:16:44:06
doesn't

00:16:44:06 - 00:16:44:24
make sense

00:16:44:24 - 00:16:44:27
to

00:16:44:27 - 00:16:44:38
take

00:16:44:38 - 00:16:45:28
ghosts.

00:16:45:30 - 00:16:45:48
All right.

00:16:45:48 - 00:16:45:57
And

00:16:45:57 - 00:16:46:21
now,

00:16:46:21 - 00:16:46:39
now,

00:16:46:39 - 00:16:46:48
now,

00:16:46:48 - 00:16:47:09
meanwhile,

00:16:47:09 - 00:16:47:25
down

00:16:47:25 - 00:16:47:40
and

00:16:47:40 - 00:16:47:56
down

00:16:47:56 - 00:16:48:01
And

00:16:48:01 - 00:16:48:19
bottom

00:16:48:19 - 00:16:48:39
line,

00:16:48:39 - 00:16:48:55
I mean,

00:16:48:55 - 00:16:49:17
what

00:16:49:17 - 00:16:49:42
exactly

00:16:49:42 - 00:16:49:49
is

00:16:49:49 - 00:16:50:07
actually

00:16:50:07 - 00:16:50:24
happening?

00:16:50:24 - 00:16:50:31
So,

00:16:50:31 - 00:16:50:43
James,

00:16:50:43 - 00:16:50:54
coming

00:16:50:54 - 00:16:51:00
off

00:16:51:00 - 00:16:51:03
the

00:16:51:03 - 00:16:51:18
reset

00:16:51:18 - 00:16:51:25
with

00:16:51:25 - 00:16:51:45
a long

00:16:51:45 - 00:16:51:59
sword

00:16:51:59 - 00:16:52:06
and

00:16:52:06 - 00:16:53:02
boots.

00:16:53:02 - 00:16:53:11
So

00:16:53:11 - 00:16:53:43
our spacing

00:16:53:43 - 00:16:53:51
is

00:16:53:51 - 00:16:53:58
going

00:16:53:58 - 00:16:54:07
to be

00:16:54:07 - 00:16:55:04
amazing.

00:16:55:04 - 00:16:55:21
No

00:16:55:21 - 00:16:55:57
panic.

00:16:55:57 - 00:16:56:20
Now,

00:16:56:20 - 00:16:56:54
I do think

00:16:56:54 - 00:16:57:03
that

00:16:57:03 - 00:16:57:34
the

00:16:57:34 - 00:16:59:25
long sword

00:16:59:25 - 00:16:59:33
I

00:16:59:33 - 00:16:59:43
don't

00:16:59:43 - 00:16:59:51
know

00:16:59:51 - 00:16:59:56
if

00:16:59:56 - 00:17:00:03
that's

00:17:00:03 - 00:17:00:18
actually

00:17:00:18 - 00:17:00:28
better

00:17:00:28 - 00:17:01:33
than dagger.

00:17:01:33 - 00:17:01:51
Oh

00:17:01:51 - 00:17:02:06
wait,

00:17:02:06 - 00:17:02:22
six.

00:17:02:22 - 00:17:02:45
Is that

00:17:02:45 - 00:17:03:07
again?

00:17:03:07 - 00:17:03:25
Guys,

00:17:03:25 - 00:17:03:34
It's

00:17:03:34 - 00:17:04:01
over.

00:17:04:01 - 00:17:04:42
It's

00:17:04:42 - 00:17:04:58
guys.

00:17:04:58 - 00:17:05:04
I'm

00:17:05:04 - 00:17:05:33
sorry.

00:17:05:33 - 00:17:06:07
And

00:17:06:07 - 00:17:06:21
it's

00:17:06:21 - 00:17:06:37
over

00:17:06:37 - 00:17:06:55
for.

00:17:06:55 - 00:17:07:06
For

00:17:07:06 - 00:17:07:19
North

00:17:07:19 - 00:17:08:11
America.

00:17:08:11 - 00:17:08:25
It is

00:17:08:25 - 00:17:08:33
going

00:17:08:33 - 00:17:08:40
to

00:17:08:54 - 00:17:09:19
ALCS

00:17:09:19 - 00:17:09:41
fans.

00:17:09:41 - 00:17:09:55
Yeah,

00:17:09:55 - 00:17:10:12
guys,

00:17:10:12 - 00:17:10:26
just.

00:17:10:26 - 00:17:10:44
Just

00:17:10:44 - 00:17:11:00
just

00:17:11:00 - 00:17:11:11
look

00:17:11:11 - 00:17:11:24
away,

00:17:11:24 - 00:17:11:56
man.

00:17:11:56 - 00:17:12:07
There's

00:17:12:07 - 00:17:12:12
an

00:17:12:12 - 00:17:12:43
imposter

00:17:12:43 - 00:17:12:50
in

00:17:12:50 - 00:17:13:04
ball,

00:17:13:04 - 00:17:13:13
and

00:17:13:13 - 00:17:13:24
that's

00:17:13:24 - 00:17:13:33
not

00:17:13:33 - 00:17:13:46
sexy.

00:17:13:46 - 00:17:14:11
De

00:17:14:33 - 00:17:14:56
Vargas

00:17:14:56 - 00:17:15:05
is

00:17:15:05 - 00:17:15:25
definitely

00:17:15:25 - 00:17:15:32
going.

00:17:15:32 - 00:17:16:44
Oh,

00:17:16:44 - 00:17:17:16
the

00:17:17:16 - 00:17:17:22
the

00:17:17:22 - 00:17:17:42
gleaming

00:17:17:42 - 00:17:17:58
quill

00:17:17:58 - 00:17:18:18
doesn't

00:17:18:18 - 00:17:18:43
break

00:17:18:43 - 00:17:19:12
the shield,

00:17:19:12 - 00:17:19:20
so it

00:17:19:20 - 00:17:19:33
doesn't

00:17:19:33 - 00:17:19:46
stop

00:17:19:46 - 00:17:20:27
the reset.

00:17:20:27 - 00:17:20:52
Honestly,

00:17:20:52 - 00:17:21:05
that's

00:17:21:05 - 00:17:21:28
a change

00:17:21:28 - 00:17:21:39
that I

00:17:21:39 - 00:17:21:48
think

00:17:21:48 - 00:17:21:59
should

00:17:21:59 - 00:17:22:46
happen.

00:17:22:51 - 00:17:23:16
I think

00:17:23:16 - 00:17:23:36
I think

00:17:23:36 - 00:17:24:01
damaging

00:17:24:01 - 00:17:24:18
shield

00:17:24:18 - 00:17:24:27
should

00:17:24:27 - 00:17:24:43
stop

00:17:24:43 - 00:17:25:51
recalls.

00:17:26:02 - 00:17:26:11
I

00:17:26:11 - 00:17:26:20
think

00:17:26:20 - 00:17:26:29
it's

00:17:26:29 - 00:17:27:01
really,

00:17:27:01 - 00:17:27:14
really,

00:17:27:14 - 00:17:27:25
really

00:17:27:25 - 00:17:27:43
bad

00:17:27:43 - 00:17:28:20
that

00:17:28:20 - 00:17:28:30
that

00:17:28:30 - 00:17:28:46
doesn't

00:17:28:46 - 00:17:28:58
work

00:17:28:58 - 00:17:29:07
that

00:17:29:07 - 00:17:29:36
way.

00:17:29:42 - 00:17:29:54
Well,

00:17:29:54 - 00:17:30:07
is he

00:17:30:07 - 00:17:30:19
just

00:17:30:19 - 00:17:31:13
dead?

00:17:31:28 - 00:17:31:39
Oh,

00:17:31:39 - 00:17:31:44
my

00:17:31:44 - 00:17:31:55
God.

00:17:31:55 - 00:17:32:04
Wait.

00:17:32:04 - 00:17:32:25
The flash

00:17:32:25 - 00:17:33:05
failed.

00:17:33:05 - 00:17:33:16
Who?

00:17:33:16 - 00:17:33:43
He was

00:17:33:43 - 00:17:33:59
dead,

00:17:33:59 - 00:17:34:10
but

00:17:34:10 - 00:17:34:28
Flash

00:17:34:28 - 00:17:34:46
failed.

00:17:34:46 - 00:17:34:57
That

00:17:34:57 - 00:17:35:31
sucks.

00:17:35:31 - 00:17:35:40
Which

00:17:35:40 - 00:17:35:49
means

00:17:35:49 - 00:17:36:07
sticks.

00:17:36:07 - 00:17:36:10
He

00:17:36:10 - 00:17:36:18
can

00:17:36:18 - 00:17:36:27
kind

00:17:36:27 - 00:17:36:30

00:17:36:30 - 00:17:36:43
keep

00:17:36:43 - 00:17:36:50

00:17:38:36 - 00:17:38:49

00:17:38:49 - 00:17:39:22
bottling.

00:17:39:25 - 00:17:40:01
Okay.

00:17:40:31 - 00:17:40:49
I like

00:17:40:49 - 00:17:40:57
the

00:17:41:13 - 00:17:41:43

00:17:43:28 - 00:17:43:37

00:17:43:37 - 00:17:44:19
Wait

even

00:17:46:40 - 00:17:47:28
happen

00:17:47:28 - 00:17:47:47
on

00:17:47:47 - 00:17:48:14

he has nothing else

00:17:53:31 - 00:17:53:40

00:17:53:40 - 00:17:53:49
This

00:17:53:49 - 00:17:54:19
bottling

00:17:54:19 - 00:17:54:27

Oh,

00:17:56:42 - 00:17:56:49
it

00:17:56:49 - 00:17:57:44
could

00:17:57:44 - 00:17:58:28
kill

00:17:58:28 - 00:17:58:35
you.

00:17:58:35 - 00:17:59:00
Oh,

it

00:18:13:30 - 00:18:13:51
feels like.

Okay

00:18:43:13 - 00:18:43:39
goal.

00:18:43:44 - 00:18:44:00
Can you

00:18:44:00 - 00:18:44:27
imagine

00:18:44:27 - 00:18:44:45
Ari

00:18:44:45 - 00:18:45:25
unironically

00:18:45:25 - 00:18:45:41

00:18:46:13 - 00:18:46:35
gorgeous,

00:18:46:35 - 00:18:46:44
though

00:18:46:44 - 00:18:46:55
it would

00:18:46:55 - 00:18:47:09
never

00:18:47:09 - 00:18:47:49
happen.

00:18:47:49 - 00:18:48:00
It

00:18:48:00 - 00:18:48:09
would

00:18:48:09 - 00:18:48:28
never

00:18:48:28 - 00:18:48:48
happen

00:18:49:48 - 00:18:50:27
unless.

00:18:50:27 - 00:18:50:36
And

00:18:50:36 - 00:18:50:53
unless

00:18:50:53 - 00:18:51:16
Scroggins

00:18:51:16 - 00:18:51:23
is

00:18:51:23 - 00:18:51:45
dropping.

00:18:51:45 - 00:18:52:21
Bang.

00:18:52:30 - 00:18:53:06
Okay.

00:18:53:06 - 00:18:53:31
All right.

00:18:53:31 - 00:18:53:54
The game is

00:18:53:54 - 00:18:54:07
over,

00:18:54:07 - 00:18:54:43
guys.

00:18:54:57 - 00:18:55:12
It was

00:18:55:12 - 00:18:55:15
a

00:18:55:15 - 00:18:55:46
valiant

00:18:55:46 - 00:18:56:06
effort

00:18:56:06 - 00:18:56:15
for

00:18:56:15 - 00:18:56:27
North

00:18:56:27 - 00:18:56:56
America.

00:18:56:56 - 00:18:57:05
It

00:18:57:05 - 00:18:57:27
really.

00:18:57:27 - 00:18:57:34
It

00:18:57:34 - 00:18:57:57
truly

00:18:57:57 - 00:18:58:12
was,

00:18:58:12 - 00:18:58:26
guys.

00:18:58:26 - 00:18:58:31
It

00:18:58:31 - 00:18:58:48
truly

00:18:58:48 - 00:18:58:58
was.

00:18:58:58 - 00:18:59:02
It

00:18:59:02 - 00:18:59:15
was.

00:18:59:15 - 00:18:59:31
It was

00:18:59:31 - 00:18:59:38
an

00:18:59:38 - 00:19:00:25
absolutely

00:19:00:25 - 00:19:00:52
valiant

00:19:00:52 - 00:19:01:33
effort.

00:19:01:33 - 00:19:02:16
Even

00:19:02:16 - 00:19:02:45
like

00:19:02:49 - 00:19:03:09
this

00:19:03:09 - 00:19:03:37
draft

00:19:03:37 - 00:19:03:46
is

00:19:03:46 - 00:19:04:12
worse

00:19:04:12 - 00:19:04:22
than

00:19:04:22 - 00:19:04:28
the

00:19:04:28 - 00:19:04:55
previous

00:19:04:55 - 00:19:05:09
game

00:19:05:09 - 00:19:05:54
ones

00:19:05:54 - 00:19:06:34
because

00:19:06:34 - 00:19:06:54
there

00:19:06:54 - 00:19:06:57
are

00:19:06:57 - 00:19:07:28
Yassuo

00:19:07:28 - 00:19:07:34
and

00:19:07:34 - 00:19:07:46
Grau.

00:19:07:46 - 00:19:08:00
I guess

00:19:08:00 - 00:19:08:04
in

00:19:08:04 - 00:19:08:15
order

00:19:08:15 - 00:19:08:22
to

00:19:08:22 - 00:19:08:31
have

00:19:08:31 - 00:19:08:55
value,

00:19:08:55 - 00:19:09:46
you need

00:19:19:31 - 00:19:20:34

00:19:44:11 - 00:19:44:47
So,

00:19:44:47 - 00:19:45:05

though.

00:19:47:31 - 00:19:47:56
Honestly,

00:19:47:56 - 00:19:48:09
I think

00:19:48:09 - 00:19:48:16

00:19:48:16 - 00:19:48:25

00:19:48:25 - 00:19:48:30

00:19:48:37 - 00:19:49:12
a24.

00:19:49:12 - 00:19:49:30
I think

00:19:49:30 - 00:19:49:37
that

00:19:49:37 - 00:19:49:44
should

00:19:49:44 - 00:19:49:49

the

00:20:07:39 - 00:20:08:47
XP.

00:20:09:16 - 00:20:09:28
Even

00:20:09:28 - 00:20:09:36
though

00:20:09:36 - 00:20:09:41
if

00:20:09:41 - 00:20:09:46
they

00:20:09:46 - 00:20:09:59
actually

00:20:09:59 - 00:20:10:31

the XP

00:20:11:07 - 00:20:11:22

00:20:11:22 - 00:20:11:51
does

00:20:12:03 - 00:20:12:19
so.

00:20:12:19 - 00:20:12:31
So

00:20:12:31 - 00:20:13:02

00:20:13:48 - 00:20:14:04
you

00:20:14:04 - 00:20:14:13

it's

00:20:14:29 - 00:20:14:51
not.

00:20:14:52 - 00:20:15:10
So

00:20:15:10 - 00:20:15:30
even

00:20:15:30 - 00:20:15:43
if you

00:20:15:43 - 00:20:16:03

00:20:33:00 - 00:20:33:39
bad.

00:20:33:57 - 00:20:34:04
It's

00:20:34:04 - 00:20:34:22

very

00:20:34:35 - 00:20:34:49
very

00:20:34:49 - 00:20:35:21
bad.

00:20:36:12 - 00:20:36:27
Now.

00:20:36:27 - 00:20:36:50
Okay

00:20:44:29 - 00:20:44:47
Now,

00:20:44:47 - 00:20:45:07

00:20:45:07 - 00:20:45:18

have

00:20:48:23 - 00:20:48:36
just

00:20:48:36 - 00:20:48:52
been

00:20:48:52 - 00:20:49:04

00:20:49:04 - 00:20:49:24
Goree

00:20:49:24 - 00:20:49:33
or

00:20:49:33 - 00:20:49:53
River,

00:20:49:53 - 00:20:50:09
that would have

00:20:50:09 - 00:20:50:16
been

00:20:50:16 - 00:20:51:50
so much better

00:20:51:54 - 00:20:52:10
because

00:20:52:10 - 00:20:52:24
they're

00:20:52:24 - 00:20:52:30
the

00:20:52:30 - 00:20:52:49

point

00:20:53:29 - 00:20:54:34
of the draft.

00:20:54:34 - 00:20:55:00
So

00:20:55:17 - 00:20:55:39
it's a

00:20:55:44 - 00:20:56:02
very

00:20:56:02 - 00:20:56:24

00:22:31:57 - 00:22:32:06
that

00:22:32:06 - 00:22:32:11
or

00:22:32:11 - 00:22:32:40
what?

00:22:32:51 - 00:22:33:12
That was

00:22:33:12 - 00:22:33:59
terrible

00:22:33:59 - 00:22:34:31
that I

00:22:34:31 - 00:22:34:42
don't

00:22:34:42 - 00:22:34:51
know

00:22:34:51 - 00:22:35:04
who

00:22:35:04 - 00:22:35:20
called

00:22:35:20 - 00:22:35:27
for

00:22:35:27 - 00:22:36:00
that

00:22:36:03 - 00:22:36:32
that was

00:22:36:32 - 00:22:36:48
that

00:22:36:48 - 00:22:37:17
was an

00:22:37:17 - 00:22:37:46
absolute

00:22:37:46 - 00:22:38:12
weight

00:22:38:16 - 00:22:39:18
Got it down.

00:22:39:18 - 00:22:39:57
You cannot

00:22:39:57 - 00:22:40:39
deny

00:22:40:39 - 00:22:40:48
that

00:22:40:48 - 00:22:41:36
the sun

00:22:41:36 - 00:22:41:49
will

00:22:41:49 - 00:22:42:05
get

00:22:42:05 - 00:22:42:21
his

00:22:42:21 - 00:22:42:50
mark

00:22:42:50 - 00:22:43:30
every

00:22:43:30 - 00:22:44:02
damn

00:22:44:02 - 00:22:44:47
time

00:22:44:47 - 00:22:45:21
you go

00:22:45:21 - 00:22:46:17
without a flash.

00:22:46:17 - 00:22:46:40
I believe

00:22:46:40 - 00:22:46:48
that

00:22:46:48 - 00:22:47:06
I owe

00:22:47:06 - 00:22:47:24
Golden

00:22:47:24 - 00:22:47:47
Guardians

00:22:47:47 - 00:22:48:18
an apology.

00:22:48:18 - 00:22:48:23
I

00:22:48:23 - 00:22:49:03
wasn't.

00:22:49:03 - 00:22:49:08
I

00:22:49:08 - 00:22:49:22
wasn't

00:22:49:22 - 00:22:49:44
familiar

00:22:49:44 - 00:22:49:51
with

00:22:49:51 - 00:22:50:30
their game

00:22:50:30 - 00:22:50:31
a

00:22:50:31 - 00:22:50:42
little

00:22:50:42 - 00:22:50:49
bit

00:22:50:49 - 00:22:51:25
more.

00:22:51:25 - 00:22:51:39
Oh,

00:22:51:39 - 00:22:53:09
my Lord.

00:22:53:09 - 00:22:53:38
I thought

00:22:53:38 - 00:22:53:45
that

00:22:53:45 - 00:22:53:58
he was

00:22:53:58 - 00:22:54:07
just

00:22:54:07 - 00:22:54:14
going

00:22:54:14 - 00:22:54:19
to

00:22:54:19 - 00:22:55:37
insta die.

00:22:55:37 - 00:22:55:48
But

00:22:55:48 - 00:22:56:07
he didn't

00:22:56:07 - 00:22:56:24
ends

00:22:56:24 - 00:22:56:43
today.

00:22:56:43 - 00:22:56:49
Well,

00:22:56:49 - 00:22:56:54
let

00:22:56:54 - 00:22:57:07
me see

00:22:57:07 - 00:22:58:06
the replay.

00:22:58:06 - 00:22:58:40
The way

00:22:58:40 - 00:22:58:44
it

00:22:58:44 - 00:22:58:58
goes,

00:22:58:58 - 00:22:59:29
Guardians

00:22:59:29 - 00:22:59:43
might

00:22:59:43 - 00:23:00:12
win

00:23:01:13 - 00:23:01:55
where

00:23:01:55 - 00:23:02:04
they're

00:23:02:04 - 00:23:02:11
going

00:23:02:11 - 00:23:02:24
to get

00:23:02:24 - 00:23:02:29
the

00:23:02:29 - 00:23:02:51
dragon.

00:23:02:51 - 00:23:02:56
They're

00:23:02:56 - 00:23:03:03
going

00:23:03:03 - 00:23:03:07
to

00:23:03:07 - 00:23:03:52
stabilize.

00:23:03:52 - 00:23:04:03
And

00:23:04:03 - 00:23:04:24
now

00:23:04:31 - 00:23:05:07
we go

00:23:05:07 - 00:23:05:13
to

00:23:05:13 - 00:23:05:43
Guardians.

00:23:05:43 - 00:23:06:30
Where?

00:23:06:30 - 00:23:06:52
What is

00:23:06:52 - 00:23:07:06
going

00:23:07:06 - 00:23:07:46
on?

00:23:08:13 - 00:23:08:24
It's

00:23:08:24 - 00:23:08:43
going

00:23:08:43 - 00:23:09:05
to

00:23:09:45 - 00:23:10:03
last

00:23:10:03 - 00:23:10:13
on

00:23:10:13 - 00:23:10:40
here

00:23:10:40 - 00:23:10:58
as

00:23:10:58 - 00:23:11:22
well.

00:23:11:22 - 00:23:11:49
Trim B

00:23:11:49 - 00:23:12:12
Crombie

00:23:12:12 - 00:23:12:25
said

00:23:12:25 - 00:23:12:32
that

00:23:12:32 - 00:23:12:46
he has

00:23:12:46 - 00:23:12:59
really

00:23:12:59 - 00:23:13:19
important

00:23:13:19 - 00:23:13:37
meetings

00:23:13:37 - 00:23:14:09
today,

00:23:14:15 - 00:23:14:31
so

00:23:14:31 - 00:23:14:56
I assume

00:23:14:56 - 00:23:15:01
that

00:23:15:01 - 00:23:15:09
it's

00:23:15:09 - 00:23:16:06
fanatic.

00:23:16:12 - 00:23:17:31
I just got the call.

00:23:17:31 - 00:23:18:05
You just got home

00:23:18:05 - 00:23:18:25
okay.

00:23:18:25 - 00:23:18:34
Is

00:23:18:34 - 00:23:19:01
the problem

00:23:19:01 - 00:23:19:37
dude,

00:23:19:49 - 00:23:20:07
Golden

00:23:20:07 - 00:23:21:05
Guardians

00:23:21:05 - 00:23:21:34
might win

00:23:21:34 - 00:23:22:04
this game

00:23:22:04 - 00:23:22:12
and

00:23:22:12 - 00:23:22:31
they should

00:23:22:31 - 00:23:22:37
have

00:23:22:37 - 00:23:22:48
won.

00:23:22:48 - 00:23:23:00
Game

00:23:23:00 - 00:23:23:22
one

00:23:23:22 - 00:23:23:36
goes

00:23:23:36 - 00:23:24:01
all out.

00:23:24:01 - 00:23:24:16
He will

00:23:24:16 - 00:23:24:30
be.

00:23:24:30 - 00:23:24:57
Really?

00:23:24:57 - 00:23:25:24
Yeah.

00:23:25:24 - 00:23:25:48
They should

00:23:25:48 - 00:23:25:53
have

00:23:25:53 - 00:23:26:02
won

00:23:26:02 - 00:23:26:13
game

00:23:26:13 - 00:23:26:42
one.

00:23:26:47 - 00:23:27:01
Try

00:23:27:01 - 00:23:27:07
and

00:23:27:07 - 00:23:27:27
maybe

00:23:27:27 - 00:23:27:37
do

00:23:27:37 - 00:23:27:55
something,

00:23:27:55 - 00:23:28:03
but

00:23:28:03 - 00:23:28:12
it's a

00:23:28:12 - 00:23:28:21
little

00:23:28:21 - 00:23:28:33
bit

00:23:29:09 - 00:23:29:38
sick.

00:23:29:40 - 00:23:30:04
Yes.

00:23:30:05 - 00:23:30:18
In

00:23:30:18 - 00:23:30:32
hype,

00:23:30:32 - 00:23:31:22
actually.

00:23:31:53 - 00:23:32:36
Hey,

00:23:32:36 - 00:23:32:49
Nick,

00:23:32:49 - 00:23:32:58
this

00:23:32:58 - 00:23:33:21
hive

00:23:33:21 - 00:23:34:03
took

00:23:34:03 - 00:23:34:13
it's

00:23:34:13 - 00:23:34:33
actually

00:23:34:33 - 00:23:34:46
Hive

00:23:34:46 - 00:23:35:18
did

00:23:38:11 - 00:23:38:27
Nick.

00:23:38:27 - 00:23:39:34
Hopefully

00:23:39:34 - 00:23:40:04
when

00:23:40:04 - 00:23:40:57
I got here,

00:23:40:57 - 00:23:41:15
they just

00:23:41:15 - 00:23:41:31
fought him

00:23:41:31 - 00:23:41:34
a

00:23:41:34 - 00:23:41:45
little

00:23:41:45 - 00:23:41:55
bit.

00:23:41:55 - 00:23:43:26
No,

00:23:43:26 - 00:23:44:21
no,

00:23:44:21 - 00:23:45:03
no.

00:23:45:03 - 00:23:45:57
Oh,

00:23:45:57 - 00:23:46:15
that's.

00:23:46:15 - 00:23:46:53
Whoa.

00:23:46:53 - 00:23:47:15
Sorry.

00:23:47:31 - 00:23:47:40
Well,

00:23:47:40 - 00:23:47:45
they

00:23:47:45 - 00:23:48:12
got out.

00:23:48:12 - 00:23:48:37
Welcome

00:23:48:37 - 00:23:48:52
back

00:23:48:52 - 00:23:49:04
to the

00:23:49:04 - 00:23:49:24
bounce

00:23:49:24 - 00:23:49:42
house.

00:23:49:42 - 00:23:49:57
Pick

00:23:49:57 - 00:23:50:02
out

00:23:50:02 - 00:23:50:09
your

00:23:50:09 - 00:23:50:34
gown,

00:23:51:41 - 00:23:53:01
genius.

00:23:53:48 - 00:23:55:07
To my

00:23:55:07 - 00:23:55:51
judge.

00:23:55:51 - 00:23:56:22
Nothing

00:23:56:22 - 00:23:57:00
to be.

00:23:57:00 - 00:23:58:31
Oh.

00:23:58:31 - 00:23:58:49
Oh,

00:23:58:49 - 00:23:58:57
my

00:23:58:57 - 00:23:59:07
God.

00:23:59:07 - 00:23:59:13
If

00:23:59:13 - 00:23:59:18
they

00:23:59:18 - 00:23:59:25
got

00:23:59:25 - 00:23:59:42
Mountain

00:23:59:42 - 00:24:00:01
Dragon,

00:24:00:01 - 00:24:00:16
dude,

00:24:00:16 - 00:24:00:43
if they got

00:24:00:43 - 00:24:00:57
Mountain

00:24:00:57 - 00:24:01:15
Drake.

00:24:01:15 - 00:24:01:40
Oh,

00:24:01:40 - 00:24:02:02
my

00:24:02:11 - 00:24:02:27
God.

00:24:02:27 - 00:24:02:56
Hey,

00:24:02:56 - 00:24:03:10
it's

00:24:03:10 - 00:24:03:19
not

00:24:03:19 - 00:24:03:34
okay.

00:24:03:34 - 00:24:03:45
But

00:24:03:45 - 00:24:03:52
it's

00:24:03:52 - 00:24:04:33
okay.

00:24:04:33 - 00:24:04:42
We

00:24:04:42 - 00:24:05:24
take those

00:24:05:24 - 00:24:05:31
and

00:24:05:31 - 00:24:05:48
we take

00:24:05:48 - 00:24:05:51
it.

00:24:05:51 - 00:24:05:54
We

00:24:05:54 - 00:24:06:23
take the win.

00:24:06:23 - 00:24:06:48
The true

00:24:06:48 - 00:24:07:10
critics

00:24:07:10 - 00:24:07:13
are

00:24:07:13 - 00:24:07:42
true.

00:24:08:15 - 00:24:09:07
The real problem

00:24:09:07 - 00:24:09:16
is

00:24:09:16 - 00:24:09:25
that

00:24:09:25 - 00:24:09:37
there's

00:24:09:37 - 00:24:09:54
no

00:24:09:54 - 00:24:10:15
answer

00:24:10:15 - 00:24:10:22
to

00:24:10:22 - 00:24:10:49
Yasuo

00:24:10:49 - 00:24:11:20
Goggles,

00:24:11:20 - 00:24:11:34
like

00:24:11:34 - 00:24:11:51
as

00:24:11:51 - 00:24:12:00
they

00:24:12:00 - 00:24:12:18
keep

00:24:12:18 - 00:24:12:32
getting

00:24:12:32 - 00:24:12:45
more

00:24:12:45 - 00:24:13:35
items

00:24:13:40 - 00:24:14:20
because

00:24:14:47 - 00:24:15:18
their biology

00:24:15:18 - 00:24:15:34
dropped

00:24:15:34 - 00:24:15:59
is so

00:24:15:59 - 00:24:16:37
crucial.

00:24:16:37 - 00:24:16:48
It's

00:24:16:48 - 00:24:17:02
he.

00:24:17:13 - 00:24:17:42
Yeah.

00:24:17:42 - 00:24:17:54
I was

00:24:17:54 - 00:24:18:03
going

00:24:18:03 - 00:24:18:19
to say

00:24:18:19 - 00:24:18:43
because

00:24:18:43 - 00:24:18:48
of

00:24:18:48 - 00:24:19:17
the draft.

00:24:19:17 - 00:24:19:37
Yes

00:24:19:37 - 00:24:20:09
it is.

00:24:20:15 - 00:24:20:24
And

00:24:20:24 - 00:24:20:36
game

00:24:20:36 - 00:24:20:45
one

00:24:20:45 - 00:24:20:54
was

00:24:27:42 - 00:24:29:00

00:24:29:18 - 00:24:29:31
I'm

00:24:29:31 - 00:24:30:05
kidding.

00:24:30:05 - 00:24:30:27
All right

00:24:30:27 - 00:24:30:48
I was

00:24:30:48 - 00:24:31:10
that was

00:24:31:14 - 00:24:31:16

00:24:31:16 - 00:24:31:28
little

00:24:31:28 - 00:24:31:43

00:24:32:19 - 00:24:33:15

00:24:33:19 - 00:24:33:57
little coke

00:24:33:57 - 00:24:34:21

00:24:34:21 - 00:24:34:28
that

00:24:34:28 - 00:24:34:39
was a

00:24:34:39 - 00:24:35:18
little

00:24:35:45 - 00:24:36:12
oh

00:24:36:12 - 00:24:36:28
my

00:24:36:28 - 00:24:36:48
God.

00:24:38:13 - 00:24:38:38
Because

00:24:38:49 - 00:24:39:01
they

00:24:39:01 - 00:24:39:14
do

00:24:39:14 - 00:24:39:27
like

00:24:39:27 - 00:24:39:34
when

00:24:39:34 - 00:24:39:55
biology

00:24:39:55 - 00:24:40:03
is

00:24:40:03 - 00:24:40:15
going

00:24:40:15 - 00:24:40:39
into them.

00:24:40:39 - 00:24:40:46
So

00:24:40:46 - 00:24:41:00
they would

00:24:41:00 - 00:24:41:13
just,

00:24:41:13 - 00:24:41:16
you

00:24:41:16 - 00:24:41:27

00:24:41:27 - 00:24:41:47
start

00:24:41:47 - 00:24:42:16
the Drake,

00:24:42:16 - 00:24:42:55
they come to them

00:24:42:55 - 00:24:43:01
and

00:24:43:01 - 00:24:43:12
then

00:24:43:12 - 00:24:43:31
it'll be

00:24:43:31 - 00:24:44:25
perfect.

00:24:44:40 - 00:24:45:37
Oh,

00:24:45:41 - 00:24:45:57
they're

00:24:46:01 - 00:24:46:28

00:24:46:28 - 00:24:46:59

00:24:48:27 - 00:24:48:43

00:24:48:43 - 00:24:49:07

00:24:51:52 - 00:24:52:05
pale

00:24:52:05 - 00:24:52:54
blush.

00:24:53:11 - 00:24:53:22
Go,

00:24:53:22 - 00:24:54:38
America.

00:24:54:39 - 00:24:55:01
Tell him

00:24:55:01 - 00:24:55:39
twice

00:24:55:39 - 00:24:55:51

00:24:56:02 - 00:24:56:15
because.

00:24:56:15 - 00:24:56:29
Yes,

00:24:56:29 - 00:24:56:34

00:24:59:49 - 00:25:00:28
sacrifice.

00:25:00:28 - 00:25:00:57
I feel

00:25:00:57 - 00:25:01:24
I felt

00:25:01:24 - 00:25:01:33
like

00:25:01:33 - 00:25:01:45
Hook

00:25:01:45 - 00:25:02:15

00:25:04:49 - 00:25:05:06

00:25:05:22 - 00:25:05:55
No,

00:25:06:07 - 00:25:06:27

00:25:06:27 - 00:25:06:43
So

Black

Oh,

00:27:02:18 - 00:27:02:24

Oh,

00:27:10:40 - 00:27:10:48
we

00:27:10:48 - 00:27:10:58
missed

00:27:10:58 - 00:27:11:02
the

00:27:11:02 - 00:27:11:13
black

00:27:11:13 - 00:27:11:33
Shield.

00:27:11:33 - 00:27:12:43
Oh,

00:27:12:43 - 00:27:12:52
not

00:27:12:52 - 00:27:13:17
the bombshell.

00:27:13:17 - 00:27:13:22
He

00:27:13:22 - 00:27:14:27
missed the cue.

00:27:14:27 - 00:27:14:52
I say,

00:27:14:52 - 00:27:15:10
how?

00:27:15:19 - 00:27:15:42
What

00:27:15:48 - 00:27:16:15
selfie?

00:27:16:15 - 00:27:16:26
How

00:27:16:26 - 00:27:16:55
are you?

00:27:17:04 - 00:27:17:13
It's

00:27:17:13 - 00:27:17:33
so

00:27:17:33 - 00:27:17:47
much

00:27:17:47 - 00:27:18:09
fun.

00:27:19:31 - 00:27:19:39
Let's

00:27:19:39 - 00:27:19:49
take a

00:27:19:49 - 00:27:19:57
look,

00:27:19:57 - 00:27:20:25
guys.

00:27:20:25 - 00:27:20:36
Let's

00:27:20:36 - 00:27:20:43
take

00:27:20:43 - 00:27:20:54
a look

00:27:20:54 - 00:27:20:58
at

00:27:20:58 - 00:27:21:13
itself.

00:27:21:13 - 00:27:21:55
Visiting.

00:27:22:37 - 00:27:23:02
What do we think

00:27:23:02 - 00:27:23:13
about

00:27:23:13 - 00:27:23:31
this?

00:27:23:31 - 00:27:23:51
I think

00:27:23:51 - 00:27:24:05
this is

00:27:24:05 - 00:27:24:12
an

00:27:24:12 - 00:27:24:36
excellent

00:27:24:36 - 00:27:24:52
looking

00:27:24:52 - 00:27:25:24
meal.

00:27:27:05 - 00:27:27:10
It

00:27:27:10 - 00:27:27:48
looks like

00:27:27:48 - 00:27:28:10
chicken

00:27:28:10 - 00:27:28:28
cutlet

00:27:28:28 - 00:27:28:39
with

00:27:28:39 - 00:27:29:18
eggs

00:27:29:22 - 00:27:29:31
here

00:27:29:31 - 00:27:29:42
because

00:27:29:42 - 00:27:29:55
they know

00:27:29:55 - 00:27:29:58
it

00:27:29:58 - 00:27:30:12
sticks.

00:27:30:12 - 00:27:30:18
They

00:27:30:18 - 00:27:30:29
don't

00:27:30:29 - 00:27:30:34
have

00:27:30:34 - 00:27:31:01
a voice

00:27:31:01 - 00:27:31:30
quality.

00:27:31:30 - 00:27:31:40
So

00:27:31:40 - 00:27:32:13
first

00:27:32:15 - 00:27:32:43
off,

00:27:32:47 - 00:27:33:00

00:27:33:00 - 00:27:33:34
a position

00:27:33:34 - 00:27:33:39

00:27:33:39 - 00:27:34:04
protect

00:27:34:04 - 00:27:34:31
his 80

00:27:34:31 - 00:27:34:59
carry

00:27:34:59 - 00:27:35:34
three,

00:27:35:34 - 00:27:35:45
he's

00:27:35:45 - 00:27:36:12
about

00:27:36:12 - 00:27:36:25
he's

00:27:36:25 - 00:27:36:48
higher

00:27:36:48 - 00:27:37:10
XP

00:27:37:10 - 00:27:37:19

00:27:37:19 - 00:27:37:26
you

00:27:37:26 - 00:27:38:45
cowards.

00:27:39:45 - 00:27:40:10
Okay

00:27:42:25 - 00:27:42:34

00:27:42:34 - 00:27:42:55
fine.

00:27:42:55 - 00:27:43:12
No.

00:27:43:12 - 00:27:44:38
Oh,

River,

00:27:45:03 - 00:27:46:49
No.

00:27:46:49 - 00:27:47:29
Okay.

00:27:48:05 - 00:27:48:19
All right.

00:27:48:19 - 00:27:48:27
They

00:27:48:27 - 00:27:48:36

00:27:48:36 - 00:27:49:12
River.

00:27:49:12 - 00:27:49:22
They're

00:27:49:22 - 00:27:49:40

00:27:49:40 - 00:27:50:00
They're down

blood

00:31:39:10 - 00:31:40:30
flow,

00:31:40:30 - 00:31:40:57
