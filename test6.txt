00:00:00:00 - 00:00:00:01
you

00:00:00:01 - 00:00:00:16
Words.

00:00:00:16 - 00:00:00:45
Yeah.

00:00:18:32 - 00:00:19:19
My dad

00:00:20:27 - 00:00:20:42
and I

00:00:20:42 - 00:00:20:49
have a

00:00:20:49 - 00:00:21:07
control

00:00:21:07 - 00:00:21:28
order.

00:00:21:28 - 00:00:21:39
That's

00:00:21:39 - 00:00:21:55
so

00:00:21:55 - 00:00:22:21
weird.

00:00:22:35 - 00:00:22:53
US

00:00:22:53 - 00:00:23:06
getting

00:00:23:06 - 00:00:23:07
a

00:00:23:07 - 00:00:23:27
mountain

00:00:23:27 - 00:00:23:34
is

00:00:23:34 - 00:00:24:54
so big.

00:00:25:12 - 00:00:25:17
I

00:00:25:17 - 00:00:25:42
respect him

00:00:25:42 - 00:00:25:51
for

00:00:25:51 - 00:00:26:49
words.

00:00:49:12 - 00:00:49:40
Uh.

00:00:58:15 - 00:00:58:37
All right.

00:00:58:37 - 00:00:58:42
I'm

00:00:58:42 - 00:00:58:49
going

00:00:58:49 - 00:00:59:02
to go

00:00:59:02 - 00:01:00:10
kill

00:01:01:12 - 00:01:02:07
this.

00:01:02:07 - 00:01:02:20
Maybe

00:01:02:20 - 00:01:02:27
I'm

00:01:02:27 - 00:01:02:52
dead.

00:01:04:08 - 00:01:04:46
Okay.

00:01:04:58 - 00:01:05:25
Not

00:01:08:13 - 00:01:08:48
I.

00:01:08:55 - 00:01:09:05
I

00:01:09:05 - 00:01:09:16
don't know

00:01:09:16 - 00:01:09:25
if I

00:01:09:25 - 00:01:09:36
have a

00:01:09:36 - 00:01:09:46
word

00:01:09:46 - 00:01:10:17
here.

00:01:10:17 - 00:01:10:21
I'm

00:01:10:21 - 00:01:10:28
going

00:01:10:28 - 00:01:10:37
around

00:01:10:37 - 00:01:11:16
bottom.

00:01:20:09 - 00:01:20:24
They

00:01:20:24 - 00:01:20:49
actually

00:01:20:49 - 00:01:21:12
fucking

00:01:21:12 - 00:01:21:41
just.

00:01:23:31 - 00:01:24:10
Oh,

00:01:33:16 - 00:01:34:10
nice

00:01:34:28 - 00:01:36:45
to fuck.

00:01:36:45 - 00:01:37:06
If

00:01:37:19 - 00:01:37:44
the other

00:01:37:44 - 00:01:38:00
turret

00:01:38:00 - 00:01:38:13
shot

00:01:38:13 - 00:01:38:22
hit,

00:01:38:22 - 00:01:38:38
we would have

00:01:38:38 - 00:01:38:54
traded

00:01:38:54 - 00:01:39:27
to

00:01:39:48 - 00:01:40:03
18

00:01:40:03 - 00:01:40:19
minutes

00:01:40:19 - 00:01:40:39
here

00:01:40:39 - 00:01:40:53
time.

00:01:40:53 - 00:01:41:18
So

00:01:43:19 - 00:01:43:57
I run

00:01:43:57 - 00:01:44:24
Mukilteo,

00:01:44:24 - 00:01:45:18
Oregon,

00:01:46:31 - 00:01:46:39
just

00:01:46:39 - 00:01:46:44
was

00:01:46:44 - 00:01:46:57
really

00:01:46:57 - 00:01:47:33
good.

00:01:49:03 - 00:01:50:11
Uh,

00:01:58:44 - 00:01:59:24
where

00:01:59:27 - 00:01:59:40
where

00:01:59:40 - 00:02:00:03
did VI

00:02:00:03 - 00:02:00:36
use

00:02:00:36 - 00:02:01:24
Harold?

00:02:01:24 - 00:02:01:37
All right,

00:02:01:37 - 00:02:01:46
we have

00:02:01:46 - 00:02:01:57
four

00:02:01:57 - 00:02:02:13
plates,

00:02:02:13 - 00:02:02:33
bottom

00:02:02:33 - 00:02:02:43
one

00:02:02:43 - 00:02:02:56
plate,

00:02:02:56 - 00:02:03:09
mid

00:02:03:09 - 00:02:03:19
three

00:02:03:19 - 00:02:03:36
plates

00:02:03:36 - 00:02:04:04
top.

00:02:04:04 - 00:02:04:15
But

00:02:04:15 - 00:02:04:33
Draven

00:02:04:33 - 00:02:04:42
just

00:02:04:42 - 00:02:04:57
got

00:02:04:57 - 00:02:05:16
fucking

00:02:05:16 - 00:02:05:25
three

00:02:05:25 - 00:02:05:51
plates.

00:02:05:51 - 00:02:06:46
Minigun.

00:02:07:22 - 00:02:07:31
Oh,

00:02:07:31 - 00:02:09:05
Grossman,

00:02:20:07 - 00:02:20:47
I couldn't.

00:02:20:47 - 00:02:21:48
I

00:02:21:48 - 00:02:22:01
didn't

00:02:22:01 - 00:02:22:10
think

00:02:22:10 - 00:02:22:24
I could

00:02:22:24 - 00:02:22:49
hit.

00:02:23:56 - 00:02:24:10
Maybe

00:02:24:10 - 00:02:24:16
I'm

00:02:24:16 - 00:02:24:50
wrong.

00:02:24:50 - 00:02:25:06
Maybe

00:02:25:06 - 00:02:25:22
I do.

00:02:25:22 - 00:02:25:30
Hit

00:02:25:30 - 00:02:25:44
drive

00:02:25:44 - 00:02:25:58
in there

00:02:25:58 - 00:02:26:16
if I go

00:02:26:16 - 00:02:26:52
for it

00:02:26:52 - 00:02:27:09
after

00:02:27:09 - 00:02:27:14
the

00:02:27:14 - 00:02:27:27
step

00:02:27:27 - 00:02:27:52
aside.

00:02:29:38 - 00:02:29:54
Not

00:02:29:54 - 00:02:30:34
sure

00:02:46:37 - 00:02:47:04
I did

00:02:47:04 - 00:02:47:15
kill

00:02:47:15 - 00:02:47:27
him

00:02:47:27 - 00:02:47:47
if we

00:02:47:47 - 00:02:48:12
ignited

00:02:48:12 - 00:02:48:45
while.

00:02:52:48 - 00:02:53:31
Fuck.

00:02:53:33 - 00:02:53:49
Yeah,

00:02:53:49 - 00:02:53:58
that's

00:02:53:58 - 00:02:54:05
my

00:02:54:05 - 00:02:54:34
bad.

00:03:01:53 - 00:03:02:02
I'm

00:03:02:02 - 00:03:02:27
not.

00:03:08:04 - 00:03:10:17
Oh

00:03:13:44 - 00:03:14:24
fuck,

00:03:15:10 - 00:03:15:18
that

00:03:15:21 - 00:03:16:08
sucks.

00:03:16:08 - 00:03:16:26
Okay,

00:03:16:26 - 00:03:16:40
that was

00:03:16:40 - 00:03:17:09
bad.

00:03:19:08 - 00:03:19:24
That's

00:03:19:24 - 00:03:19:57
bad,

00:03:19:57 - 00:03:20:11
that's

00:03:20:11 - 00:03:20:40
bad.

00:03:24:54 - 00:03:25:19
Okay.

00:03:25:49 - 00:03:26:06
I mean,

00:03:26:06 - 00:03:26:27
rumbles

00:03:26:27 - 00:03:26:43
entered

00:03:26:43 - 00:03:26:49
the

00:03:26:49 - 00:03:27:01
fight,

00:03:27:01 - 00:03:27:34
now

00:03:28:19 - 00:03:28:37
rumble

00:03:28:37 - 00:03:28:57
dies.

00:03:28:57 - 00:03:29:06
It's

00:03:29:06 - 00:03:29:49
over.

00:03:32:33 - 00:03:34:06
Uh,

00:03:37:35 - 00:03:38:09
uh.

00:03:38:40 - 00:03:38:54
And we

00:03:38:54 - 00:03:39:07
do have

00:03:39:07 - 00:03:39:28
Mountain,

00:03:39:28 - 00:03:39:45
which is

00:03:39:45 - 00:03:39:55
really

00:03:39:55 - 00:03:40:35
good.

00:03:48:25 - 00:03:49:19
Come

00:03:55:26 - 00:03:55:49
mountain

00:03:55:49 - 00:03:55:55
of

00:03:55:55 - 00:03:56:04
this

00:03:56:04 - 00:03:56:16
game

00:03:56:16 - 00:03:56:22
at

00:03:56:22 - 00:03:56:38
voice

00:03:56:38 - 00:03:57:00
chat.

00:03:57:00 - 00:03:57:19
I think

00:03:57:19 - 00:03:57:32
it'd be

00:03:57:32 - 00:03:58:12
bad.

00:03:58:14 - 00:03:58:39
Westcott

00:03:58:39 - 00:03:58:53
makes

00:03:58:53 - 00:03:59:04
bad

00:03:59:04 - 00:03:59:36
players

00:03:59:36 - 00:04:00:16
better.

00:04:04:08 - 00:04:04:19
And

00:04:04:19 - 00:04:04:28
then

00:04:04:28 - 00:04:04:39
there's

00:04:04:39 - 00:04:04:51
a new

00:04:04:51 - 00:04:05:04
type

00:04:05:04 - 00:04:05:07
of

00:04:05:07 - 00:04:05:56
toxicity,

00:04:05:56 - 00:04:06:18
the likes

00:04:06:18 - 00:04:06:25
of

00:04:06:25 - 00:04:06:36
which

00:04:06:36 - 00:04:06:48
hasn't

00:04:06:48 - 00:04:06:55
been

00:04:06:55 - 00:04:07:08
seen

00:04:07:08 - 00:04:07:22
before

00:04:07:22 - 00:04:07:30
in

00:04:07:30 - 00:04:08:09
league

00:04:08:45 - 00:04:08:54
that

00:04:08:54 - 00:04:09:00
would

00:04:09:00 - 00:04:09:19
it be

00:04:09:19 - 00:04:10:13
entered?

00:04:10:31 - 00:04:10:39
You

00:04:10:39 - 00:04:10:53
shouldn't

00:04:10:53 - 00:04:10:58
be

00:04:10:58 - 00:04:11:07
this

00:04:11:07 - 00:04:11:20
far

00:04:11:20 - 00:04:11:42
up.

00:04:23:34 - 00:04:23:47
My

00:04:23:47 - 00:04:24:44
arena.

00:04:34:17 - 00:04:34:33
Maybe

00:04:34:33 - 00:04:34:44
I could

00:04:34:44 - 00:04:34:51
have

00:04:34:51 - 00:04:35:38
hooked.

00:04:37:37 - 00:04:37:53
Maybe

00:04:37:53 - 00:04:38:04
I could

00:04:38:04 - 00:04:38:09
have

00:04:38:09 - 00:04:38:49
hooked.

00:04:39:01 - 00:04:39:14
I'm

00:04:39:14 - 00:04:39:57
an idiot.

00:04:39:57 - 00:04:40:13
I think

00:04:40:13 - 00:04:40:24
I could

00:04:40:24 - 00:04:40:30
have

00:04:40:30 - 00:04:41:09
hooked

00:04:42:00 - 00:04:42:18
back

00:04:42:18 - 00:04:42:25
and

00:04:42:25 - 00:04:42:59
hooked.

00:04:42:59 - 00:04:43:12
I'm

00:04:43:12 - 00:04:43:39
bad.

00:04:43:39 - 00:04:43:51
I'm

00:04:43:51 - 00:04:44:07
like,

00:04:44:07 - 00:04:44:25
not.

00:04:44:25 - 00:04:44:56
I'm

00:04:44:56 - 00:04:45:30
really

00:04:45:30 - 00:04:45:48
doubting

00:04:45:48 - 00:04:46:26
myself.

00:04:46:26 - 00:04:46:49
I don't know

00:04:46:49 - 00:04:47:19
why

00:04:48:00 - 00:04:48:16
doubting

00:04:48:16 - 00:04:48:36
myself

00:04:48:36 - 00:04:48:54
so

00:04:48:54 - 00:04:49:08
hard,

00:04:49:08 - 00:04:49:26
man.

00:04:52:33 - 00:04:52:39
It's

00:04:52:39 - 00:04:52:55
really

00:04:52:55 - 00:04:53:31
bad

00:04:56:57 - 00:04:57:24
to

00:04:58:15 - 00:04:58:37
grab

00:04:58:37 - 00:04:58:51
me.

00:04:58:51 - 00:04:59:27
Yeah,

00:05:00:39 - 00:05:01:24
I know.

00:05:01:24 - 00:05:02:00
And.

00:05:06:14 - 00:05:06:56
Okay,

00:05:11:18 - 00:05:11:36
I

00:05:12:21 - 00:05:12:55
we got 4

00:05:12:55 - 00:05:13:36
minutes.

00:05:14:13 - 00:05:15:25
Messi

00:05:16:21 - 00:05:16:26
here.

00:05:16:26 - 00:05:16:51
Not 4

00:05:16:51 - 00:05:17:06
minutes,

00:05:17:06 - 00:05:17:42
but 14

00:05:17:42 - 00:05:17:58
minutes.

00:05:17:58 - 00:05:18:18
Sorry.

00:05:18:18 - 00:05:18:30
Why

00:05:18:30 - 00:05:18:39
say

00:05:18:39 - 00:05:19:15
four?

00:05:19:21 - 00:05:19:26
I

00:05:19:26 - 00:05:19:33
don't

00:05:19:33 - 00:05:19:55
know.

00:05:31:22 - 00:05:32:15
Hmm.

00:05:32:15 - 00:05:32:42
Okay.

00:05:34:51 - 00:05:35:04
Why

00:05:35:04 - 00:05:36:21
ever frost

00:05:36:21 - 00:05:37:04
to snare

00:05:37:04 - 00:05:37:13
and

00:05:37:13 - 00:05:37:22
then

00:05:37:22 - 00:05:37:40
also

00:05:37:40 - 00:05:38:25
AP

00:05:38:25 - 00:05:38:45
for

00:05:38:45 - 00:05:39:01
all my

00:05:39:01 - 00:05:39:59
abilities.

00:05:44:00 - 00:05:44:07
I'm

00:05:44:07 - 00:05:44:15
going

00:05:44:15 - 00:05:44:25
to go

00:05:44:25 - 00:05:44:38
ever

00:05:44:38 - 00:05:44:54
frost

00:05:44:54 - 00:05:45:14
abyssal

00:05:45:14 - 00:05:46:19
mask.

00:06:01:12 - 00:06:01:28
I think

00:06:01:28 - 00:06:01:39
I just

00:06:01:39 - 00:06:01:51
missed

00:06:01:51 - 00:06:02:00
that

00:06:02:00 - 00:06:02:51
brush.

00:06:12:10 - 00:06:12:27
All right.

00:06:12:27 - 00:06:12:36
They're

00:06:12:36 - 00:06:13:03
conceding

00:06:13:03 - 00:06:14:00
Drake.

00:06:28:26 - 00:06:28:53
The fight

00:06:28:53 - 00:06:29:02
is

00:06:29:02 - 00:06:29:24
fucking

00:06:29:24 - 00:06:30:28
scary.

00:06:38:46 - 00:06:39:07
Fuck,

00:06:39:21 - 00:06:39:36
I need

00:06:39:36 - 00:06:40:55
900.

00:06:42:05 - 00:06:42:12
I'll

00:06:42:12 - 00:06:42:21
just

00:06:42:21 - 00:06:42:45
reset,

00:06:42:45 - 00:06:43:04
refresh

00:06:43:04 - 00:06:43:12
my

00:06:43:12 - 00:06:43:40
words.

00:06:43:40 - 00:06:43:53
Well,

00:06:43:53 - 00:06:43:59
he's

00:06:43:59 - 00:06:44:06
going

00:06:44:06 - 00:06:44:16
to do

00:06:44:16 - 00:06:44:34
dammit.

00:06:44:34 - 00:06:44:52
Zero

00:06:44:52 - 00:06:45:21
damage.

00:06:45:21 - 00:06:45:46
Yeah.

00:06:45:46 - 00:06:46:03
Once

00:06:46:03 - 00:06:46:13
I have

00:06:46:13 - 00:06:46:39
abyssal,

00:06:46:39 - 00:06:46:57
everything

00:06:46:57 - 00:06:47:07
will be

00:06:47:07 - 00:06:47:36
good.

00:06:51:51 - 00:06:52:21
Yeah.

00:06:53:31 - 00:06:53:42
This is

00:06:53:42 - 00:06:53:47
a

00:06:53:47 - 00:06:54:01
weird,

00:06:54:01 - 00:06:54:28
coordinated

00:06:54:28 - 00:06:55:12
fight.

00:06:56:02 - 00:06:56:11
They're

00:06:56:11 - 00:06:56:31
grouping

00:06:56:31 - 00:06:57:18
for

00:07:01:36 - 00:07:01:51
J.

00:07:01:53 - 00:07:02:09
Someone's

00:07:02:09 - 00:07:02:16

00:07:02:16 - 00:07:02:24

Ramona.

00:07:03:12 - 00:07:03:33
Thank you.

00:07:03:33 - 00:07:03:43
In on

00:07:03:43 - 00:07:04:10
your business

00:07:04:10 - 00:07:04:17
for

00:07:04:17 - 00:07:04:57
subbing.

00:07:11:47 - 00:07:13:35
Oh,

00:07:21:37 - 00:07:21:46
and

00:07:21:46 - 00:07:22:26
commercial

00:07:22:26 - 00:07:23:22
is,

00:07:24:05 - 00:07:24:39
uh.

00:07:29:27 - 00:07:29:45
I don't

00:07:29:45 - 00:07:29:51
know

00:07:29:51 - 00:07:29:56
what

00:07:29:56 - 00:07:30:14
we can

00:07:30:14 - 00:07:30:37
even

00:07:30:37 - 00:07:30:55
really

00:07:30:55 - 00:07:31:08
do

00:07:31:08 - 00:07:31:30
here.

00:07:36:39 - 00:07:38:16
Uh,

00:07:38:29 - 00:07:39:07
uh,

00:07:39:07 - 00:07:39:25
after

00:07:39:25 - 00:07:39:30
the

00:07:39:30 - 00:07:39:45
bad

00:07:39:45 - 00:07:40:01
chalk

00:07:40:01 - 00:07:41:02
blast.

00:07:41:25 - 00:07:41:42
That's

00:07:41:42 - 00:07:42:00
really

00:07:42:00 - 00:07:42:32
bad.

00:07:42:32 - 00:07:42:46
Oh,

00:07:42:46 - 00:07:42:59
there's

00:07:42:59 - 00:07:43:19
something,

00:07:43:19 - 00:07:43:49
Harold.

00:07:43:49 - 00:07:44:02
Oh,

00:07:44:02 - 00:07:44:33
this is not

00:07:44:33 - 00:07:44:45
good.

00:07:44:45 - 00:07:44:56
What

00:07:44:56 - 00:07:45:14
the fuck

00:07:45:14 - 00:07:45:19
is

00:07:45:19 - 00:07:45:27
that?

00:07:45:27 - 00:07:45:45
Control

00:07:45:45 - 00:07:46:24
board,

00:07:47:02 - 00:07:47:31
dude?

00:07:47:31 - 00:07:47:51
As

00:07:47:51 - 00:07:48:41
real.

00:07:48:41 - 00:07:49:15
Oh,

00:07:49:15 - 00:07:49:31
wait.

00:07:49:31 - 00:07:50:00
What?

00:07:50:02 - 00:07:50:13
Oh,

00:07:50:13 - 00:07:50:20
my

00:07:50:20 - 00:07:50:29
God.

00:07:50:29 - 00:07:50:43
Rumble.

00:07:50:43 - 00:07:51:41
Decide.

00:07:51:57 - 00:07:52:15
That's

00:07:52:15 - 00:07:53:27
Superbad

00:08:01:51 - 00:08:02:06
to

00:08:02:06 - 00:08:02:36
him.

00:08:02:36 - 00:08:02:45
It's

00:08:02:45 - 00:08:03:09
actually

00:08:03:09 - 00:08:03:18
this

00:08:03:18 - 00:08:03:28
way

00:08:03:28 - 00:08:03:41
to

00:08:03:41 - 00:08:04:17
him.

00:08:10:12 - 00:08:10:37
No,

00:08:10:37 - 00:08:11:34
to him.

00:08:13:04 - 00:08:13:22
And

00:08:13:48 - 00:08:14:36
I think

00:08:14:36 - 00:08:14:43
we

00:08:14:43 - 00:08:15:19
lose.

00:08:16:21 - 00:08:16:28
We

00:08:16:28 - 00:08:16:41
kill

00:08:16:41 - 00:08:17:20
Draven.

00:08:17:20 - 00:08:18:05
But

00:08:18:05 - 00:08:18:39
we.

00:08:18:39 - 00:08:18:46
I

00:08:18:46 - 00:08:18:55
mean,

00:08:18:55 - 00:08:18:59
we

00:08:18:59 - 00:08:19:09
kill

00:08:19:09 - 00:08:19:28
Draven.

00:08:19:28 - 00:08:19:39
We got

00:08:19:39 - 00:08:19:42
two

00:08:19:42 - 00:08:20:04
stacks

00:08:20:04 - 00:08:20:16
off

00:08:20:16 - 00:08:20:31
him,

00:08:20:31 - 00:08:20:51
but

00:08:20:51 - 00:08:21:10
I think

00:08:21:10 - 00:08:21:45
they.

00:08:21:45 - 00:08:22:10
Well,

00:08:22:10 - 00:08:22:24
no,

00:08:22:24 - 00:08:22:30
I

00:08:22:30 - 00:08:22:39
guess

00:08:22:39 - 00:08:22:58
rumble

00:08:22:58 - 00:08:23:06
will

00:08:23:06 - 00:08:23:42
get

00:08:24:01 - 00:08:24:14
it.

00:08:24:14 - 00:08:24:30
Rumble

00:08:24:30 - 00:08:24:37
can

00:08:24:37 - 00:08:24:50
stop

00:08:24:50 - 00:08:25:04
Aaron

00:08:25:04 - 00:08:25:12
but

00:08:25:12 - 00:08:25:40
yeah.

00:08:26:52 - 00:08:27:28
Mm.

00:08:27:36 - 00:08:27:48
Yeah.

00:08:27:48 - 00:08:27:54
You

00:08:27:54 - 00:08:28:03
can

00:08:28:03 - 00:08:28:13
mute

00:08:28:13 - 00:08:28:31
toxic

00:08:28:31 - 00:08:28:46
people.

00:08:28:46 - 00:08:28:49
You

00:08:28:49 - 00:08:29:00
can't

00:08:29:00 - 00:08:29:11
mute.

00:08:29:11 - 00:08:29:47
Peter's

00:08:29:47 - 00:08:30:23
true.

00:08:34:26 - 00:08:36:53
Uh,

00:08:38:07 - 00:08:38:54
all right.

00:08:42:27 - 00:08:42:41
When

00:08:42:41 - 00:08:42:55
saw

00:08:42:55 - 00:08:43:31
Frieza.

00:08:43:31 - 00:08:43:40
I

00:08:43:40 - 00:08:43:49
don't

00:08:43:49 - 00:08:43:58
know.

00:08:43:58 - 00:08:44:52
Actually,

00:08:45:00 - 00:08:45:19
I don't know

00:08:45:19 - 00:08:45:27
when

00:08:45:27 - 00:08:46:24
that happens

00:08:46:24 - 00:08:46:39
while

00:08:46:39 - 00:08:46:46
they're

00:08:46:46 - 00:08:47:06
actually

00:08:47:06 - 00:08:47:45
on it.

00:08:47:47 - 00:08:48:00
Right.

00:08:48:00 - 00:08:48:12
That's

00:08:48:12 - 00:08:48:46
bad.

00:08:48:46 - 00:08:49:02
Oh,

00:08:49:02 - 00:08:49:13
this

00:08:49:13 - 00:08:49:35
is it.

00:08:49:35 - 00:08:49:47
This

00:08:49:47 - 00:08:50:00
is our

00:08:50:00 - 00:08:50:31
comeback

00:08:52:35 - 00:08:53:00
boy.

00:08:53:22 - 00:08:53:58
What

00:08:55:17 - 00:08:55:33
is

00:08:55:33 - 00:08:56:02
here?

00:08:56:43 - 00:08:56:51
We

00:08:56:51 - 00:08:56:58
just

00:08:56:58 - 00:08:58:31
have to win this

00:08:59:00 - 00:08:59:13
way.

00:08:59:13 - 00:09:00:49
Why is she going?

00:09:03:03 - 00:09:04:01
Why did she go

00:09:04:01 - 00:09:04:28
for it?

00:09:04:28 - 00:09:05:22
Man?

00:09:12:09 - 00:09:12:39
Fuck

00:09:16:08 - 00:09:16:30
if she

00:09:16:30 - 00:09:16:40
just

00:09:16:40 - 00:09:17:52
played.

00:09:18:18 - 00:09:18:32
She's

00:09:18:32 - 00:09:18:54
saying

00:09:18:54 - 00:09:19:26
that

00:09:19:31 - 00:09:19:42
her

00:09:19:42 - 00:09:19:57
smite

00:09:19:57 - 00:09:20:04
was

00:09:20:04 - 00:09:20:15
one

00:09:20:15 - 00:09:21:03
second.

00:09:21:03 - 00:09:21:18
But

00:09:21:18 - 00:09:21:39
the thing

00:09:21:39 - 00:09:21:52
is,

00:09:21:52 - 00:09:21:59
is

00:09:21:59 - 00:09:22:06
that

00:09:22:06 - 00:09:22:22
if she

00:09:22:22 - 00:09:22:33
just

00:09:22:33 - 00:09:22:49
played

00:09:22:49 - 00:09:22:57
for

00:09:22:57 - 00:09:23:36
the fight,

00:09:23:36 - 00:09:24:01
we just

00:09:24:01 - 00:09:24:16
kill

00:09:24:16 - 00:09:24:48
them.

00:09:26:45 - 00:09:27:05
Oh,

00:09:27:05 - 00:09:27:14
my

00:09:27:14 - 00:09:27:45
God.

00:09:27:45 - 00:09:28:03
And a

00:09:28:03 - 00:09:29:14
barren them.

00:09:43:29 - 00:09:43:45
And

00:09:43:48 - 00:09:44:11
if we got

00:09:44:11 - 00:09:44:29
barren,

00:09:44:29 - 00:09:44:40
there

00:09:44:40 - 00:09:44:47
would

00:09:44:47 - 00:09:45:30
win

00:09:45:43 - 00:09:45:52
for

00:09:45:52 - 00:09:46:39
sure.

00:09:47:00 - 00:09:47:27
The issue

00:09:47:27 - 00:09:47:38
is,

00:09:47:38 - 00:09:47:43
is

00:09:47:43 - 00:09:47:56
that

00:09:47:56 - 00:09:48:09
Holy

00:09:48:09 - 00:09:48:18
Bear

00:09:48:18 - 00:09:48:30
gets

00:09:48:30 - 00:09:48:58
the solo

00:09:48:58 - 00:09:49:22
XP.

00:09:49:22 - 00:09:49:33
They're

00:09:49:33 - 00:09:50:09
right.

00:09:50:40 - 00:09:50:54
And

00:09:50:58 - 00:09:51:10
there's

00:09:51:10 - 00:09:51:14
the

00:09:51:14 - 00:09:51:36
global

00:09:51:36 - 00:09:51:59
XP

00:09:51:59 - 00:09:52:06
that

00:09:52:06 - 00:09:52:35
goes out

00:09:52:35 - 00:09:53:25
to,

00:09:56:21 - 00:09:56:48
uh,

00:09:59:22 - 00:09:59:33
let's

00:09:59:33 - 00:09:59:42
say

00:09:59:42 - 00:09:59:47
the

00:09:59:47 - 00:10:00:10
cases

00:10:00:10 - 00:10:00:14
of

00:10:00:14 - 00:10:00:36
Champion

00:10:00:36 - 00:10:01:05
1310.

00:10:01:05 - 00:10:01:13
Don't

00:10:01:13 - 00:10:01:33
know,

00:10:01:33 - 00:10:01:46
because

00:10:01:46 - 00:10:01:55
not

00:10:01:55 - 00:10:02:02
all

00:10:02:02 - 00:10:02:16
the

00:10:02:16 - 00:10:02:40
changes

00:10:02:40 - 00:10:02:43
are

00:10:02:43 - 00:10:02:56
known

00:10:02:56 - 00:10:03:25
yet.

00:10:03:36 - 00:10:04:03
We just have

00:10:04:03 - 00:10:04:08
the

00:10:04:08 - 00:10:04:28
basic

00:10:04:28 - 00:10:04:57
items.

00:10:04:57 - 00:10:05:15
I mean,

00:10:05:15 - 00:10:05:24
she's

00:10:05:24 - 00:10:05:31
going

00:10:05:31 - 00:10:05:38
to be

00:10:05:38 - 00:10:06:10
very strong,

00:10:06:10 - 00:10:06:18
but

00:10:06:18 - 00:10:06:39
Cogman

00:10:06:39 - 00:10:06:45
is

00:10:06:45 - 00:10:06:52
going

00:10:06:52 - 00:10:07:01
to be

00:10:07:01 - 00:10:07:13
king.

00:10:07:13 - 00:10:08:11
I think

00:10:08:11 - 00:10:08:22
with

00:10:08:22 - 00:10:08:29
what

00:10:08:29 - 00:10:08:34
we

00:10:08:34 - 00:10:08:42
know

00:10:08:42 - 00:10:08:51
right

00:10:08:51 - 00:10:09:09
now,

00:10:15:54 - 00:10:16:18
Aurion

00:10:16:18 - 00:10:16:24
is

00:10:16:24 - 00:10:16:42
very

00:10:16:42 - 00:10:17:00
weak.

00:10:17:00 - 00:10:17:02
I

00:10:17:02 - 00:10:17:13
don't

00:10:17:13 - 00:10:17:19
know

00:10:17:19 - 00:10:18:04
why

00:10:20:04 - 00:10:20:15
she

00:10:20:15 - 00:10:20:27
just

00:10:20:27 - 00:10:21:00
had,

00:10:50:49 - 00:10:51:32
though.

00:10:51:54 - 00:10:52:00
I

00:10:52:00 - 00:10:52:06
mean,

00:10:52:06 - 00:10:52:17
took

00:10:52:17 - 00:10:52:24
out

00:10:52:24 - 00:10:53:18
the jungle

00:10:59:16 - 00:10:59:42
I have

00:10:59:43 - 00:10:59:58
of

00:10:59:58 - 00:11:00:25
snow.

00:11:00:25 - 00:11:01:01
Oh,

00:11:07:40 - 00:11:08:16
fuck.

00:11:09:32 - 00:11:09:45
I can

00:11:09:45 - 00:11:09:52
just

00:11:09:52 - 00:11:10:31
reset

00:11:11:54 - 00:11:12:05
and

00:11:12:05 - 00:11:12:16
only

00:11:12:16 - 00:11:12:21
I'm

00:11:12:21 - 00:11:12:37
useful

00:11:12:37 - 00:11:13:10
here

00:11:15:27 - 00:11:15:41
and I

00:11:15:41 - 00:11:15:48
don't

00:11:15:48 - 00:11:15:57
have

00:11:15:57 - 00:11:17:02
jungler

00:11:22:04 - 00:11:22:17
I think

00:11:22:17 - 00:11:22:22
it

00:11:22:22 - 00:11:22:49
causes

00:11:22:49 - 00:11:23:01
with.

00:11:23:01 - 00:11:23:20
Does

00:11:23:20 - 00:11:23:24
it

00:11:23:24 - 00:11:23:36
want

00:11:23:36 - 00:11:23:47
you

00:11:23:47 - 00:11:24:09
moves

00:11:24:09 - 00:11:24:12
or

00:11:24:12 - 00:11:24:25
does

00:11:24:25 - 00:11:25:07
played.

00:11:26:06 - 00:11:26:45
I

00:11:26:51 - 00:11:27:14
depends

00:11:27:14 - 00:11:27:21
on

00:11:27:21 - 00:11:27:32
team

00:11:27:32 - 00:11:27:48
comp.

00:11:27:48 - 00:11:28:06
I think

00:11:28:06 - 00:11:28:37
I think

00:11:28:37 - 00:11:28:58
the

00:11:28:58 - 00:11:29:15
a lot

00:11:29:15 - 00:11:29:22
of the

00:11:29:22 - 00:11:29:29
new

00:11:29:29 - 00:11:29:48
methinks

00:11:29:48 - 00:11:29:54
they'll

00:11:29:54 - 00:11:30:39
change

00:11:30:39 - 00:11:30:54
game

00:11:30:54 - 00:11:31:01
by

00:11:31:01 - 00:11:31:40
game

00:11:33:30 - 00:11:33:46
I think

00:11:33:46 - 00:11:33:52
in

00:11:33:52 - 00:11:33:59
that

00:11:33:59 - 00:11:34:15
regard

00:11:34:15 - 00:11:34:22
it's

00:11:34:22 - 00:11:34:48
kind of good

00:11:34:48 - 00:11:36:19
why does he does

00:11:36:19 - 00:11:36:34
he has

00:11:36:34 - 00:11:37:21
this

00:11:37:48 - 00:11:37:57
look

00:11:37:57 - 00:11:38:00
at

00:11:38:00 - 00:11:38:04
how

00:11:38:04 - 00:11:38:14
much

00:11:38:14 - 00:11:38:22
time

00:11:38:22 - 00:11:38:29
are

00:11:38:29 - 00:11:38:38
they

00:11:38:38 - 00:11:39:18
have

00:11:40:03 - 00:11:40:17
so

00:11:40:17 - 00:11:41:36
disgusting

00:11:52:53 - 00:11:53:18
that was

00:11:53:18 - 00:11:53:25
the

00:11:53:25 - 00:11:53:42
best

00:11:53:42 - 00:11:54:59
equalizer

00:11:54:59 - 00:11:55:33
I have ever

00:11:55:33 - 00:11:55:48
seen

00:11:55:48 - 00:11:55:53
in

00:11:55:53 - 00:11:56:09
Korean

00:11:56:09 - 00:11:56:29
solo

00:11:56:29 - 00:11:57:01
kill.

00:12:05:18 - 00:12:05:54
Okay.

00:12:05:56 - 00:12:06:14
All right.

00:12:06:14 - 00:12:06:30
Can we

00:12:06:30 - 00:12:07:10
win?

00:12:09:30 - 00:12:09:51
No.

00:12:10:04 - 00:12:10:22
Kill

00:12:10:22 - 00:12:10:44
him.

00:12:17:11 - 00:12:17:55
Okay.

00:12:22:53 - 00:12:23:36
Okay.

00:12:25:49 - 00:12:26:06
While

00:12:26:06 - 00:12:26:20
I was

00:12:26:20 - 00:12:26:52
good,

00:12:30:18 - 00:12:30:25
we

00:12:30:25 - 00:12:30:45
got another

00:12:30:45 - 00:12:31:01
cloud.

00:12:31:01 - 00:12:31:37
Derek,

00:12:31:37 - 00:12:31:48
this

00:12:31:48 - 00:12:32:00
really

00:12:32:00 - 00:12:32:11
just

00:12:32:11 - 00:12:32:25
helps

00:12:32:25 - 00:12:32:36
me

00:12:32:36 - 00:12:32:43
with

00:12:32:43 - 00:12:33:18
positioning.

00:12:50:15 - 00:12:50:46
Cam,

00:12:52:06 - 00:12:52:13
I

00:12:52:13 - 00:12:52:22
won't

00:12:52:22 - 00:12:52:28
have

00:12:52:28 - 00:12:52:44
support.

00:12:52:44 - 00:12:52:55
I'm

00:12:52:55 - 00:12:53:27
completed.

00:12:53:27 - 00:12:53:43
I guess

00:12:53:43 - 00:12:54:00
my next

00:12:54:00 - 00:12:54:16
item

00:12:54:16 - 00:12:54:21
would

00:12:54:21 - 00:12:54:32
just

00:12:54:32 - 00:12:54:57
be.

00:12:55:49 - 00:12:55:53
I

00:12:55:53 - 00:12:56:00
don't

00:12:56:00 - 00:12:56:09
even

00:12:56:09 - 00:12:56:16
know.

00:12:56:16 - 00:12:57:07
Actually,

00:13:00:30 - 00:13:00:50
we are

00:13:00:50 - 00:13:01:01
you.

00:13:01:06 - 00:13:01:30
Yeah.

00:13:01:30 - 00:13:01:46
Tyler

00:13:01:46 - 00:13:02:20
absolutely

00:13:02:20 - 00:13:02:54
deserves

00:13:02:54 - 00:13:03:00
the

00:13:03:00 - 00:13:03:36
punishment.

00:13:03:36 - 00:13:03:59
What

00:13:03:59 - 00:13:04:22
punishment

00:13:04:22 - 00:13:04:28
did

00:13:04:28 - 00:13:04:46
Tyler

00:13:04:46 - 00:13:05:11
get?

00:13:06:27 - 00:13:06:34
What

00:13:06:34 - 00:13:06:41
is

00:13:06:41 - 00:13:06:57
Tyler's

00:13:06:57 - 00:13:07:55
punishment

00:13:08:45 - 00:13:08:58
As

00:13:09:00 - 00:13:09:09
real?

00:13:09:09 - 00:13:09:21
Please

00:13:09:21 - 00:13:10:08
don't die.

00:13:11:07 - 00:13:11:18
But

00:13:11:18 - 00:13:11:38
it doesn't

00:13:11:38 - 00:13:11:43
have

00:13:11:43 - 00:13:11:55
quick

00:13:11:55 - 00:13:12:41
blades.

00:13:12:41 - 00:13:13:46
Sucks.

00:13:15:16 - 00:13:15:30
Once

00:13:15:30 - 00:13:15:57
Fiora

00:13:15:57 - 00:13:16:19
has

00:13:16:19 - 00:13:16:30
more

00:13:16:30 - 00:13:16:35
of

00:13:16:35 - 00:13:16:44
Matt

00:13:16:44 - 00:13:17:31
Martius,

00:13:17:31 - 00:13:17:47
things

00:13:17:47 - 00:13:17:51
are

00:13:17:51 - 00:13:17:58
going

00:13:17:58 - 00:13:18:07
to be

00:13:18:07 - 00:13:18:21
really

00:13:18:21 - 00:13:18:59
scary.

00:13:18:59 - 00:13:20:15
I think.

00:13:33:27 - 00:13:33:30
I

00:13:36:45 - 00:13:37:03
wonder

00:13:37:03 - 00:13:37:13
if he

00:13:37:13 - 00:13:38:22
was.

00:13:42:21 - 00:13:44:31
Hmm.

00:13:46:25 - 00:13:46:57
Um.

00:13:47:54 - 00:13:48:09
I think

00:13:48:09 - 00:13:48:23
I just

00:13:48:23 - 00:13:49:21
reset.

00:13:52:33 - 00:13:52:44
We're

00:13:52:44 - 00:13:52:58
5

00:13:52:58 - 00:13:53:13
minutes.

00:13:53:13 - 00:13:53:56
Fuck.

00:13:54:43 - 00:13:54:54
Well,

00:13:54:54 - 00:13:55:12
5

00:13:55:12 - 00:13:55:29
minutes

00:13:55:29 - 00:13:55:44
is, I

00:13:55:44 - 00:13:55:55
guess,

00:13:55:55 - 00:13:56:13
clouds

00:13:56:13 - 00:13:56:20
or

00:13:56:20 - 00:13:56:40
fire

00:13:56:40 - 00:13:56:52
and

00:13:56:52 - 00:13:57:43
Baron

00:13:58:01 - 00:13:58:14
game

00:13:58:14 - 00:13:58:31
should end

00:13:58:31 - 00:13:58:42
by

00:13:58:42 - 00:13:59:18
then

00:14:00:01 - 00:14:00:14
to be

00:14:00:14 - 00:14:01:12
honest.

00:14:14:40 - 00:14:15:19
Fuck.

00:14:17:31 - 00:14:18:40
Mm.

00:14:26:52 - 00:14:27:28
Fuck.

00:14:29:15 - 00:14:29:25
All right,

00:14:29:25 - 00:14:29:29
we

00:14:29:29 - 00:14:29:47
got another

00:14:29:47 - 00:14:30:34
turret.

00:14:32:13 - 00:14:32:29
Really

00:14:32:29 - 00:14:33:12
good.

00:15:02:47 - 00:15:03:23
All right.

00:15:04:13 - 00:15:04:46
Uh,

00:15:04:46 - 00:15:05:02
I guess

00:15:05:02 - 00:15:05:15

00:15:05:36 - 00:15:06:34
Elixir.

00:15:07:28 - 00:15:07:44
This is

00:15:07:44 - 00:15:07:58
final

00:15:07:58 - 00:15:08:10
thought.

00:15:08:10 - 00:15:08:23
It.

00:15:10:10 - 00:15:10:22
And

00:15:10:22 - 00:15:10:28
it's

00:15:10:28 - 00:15:10:35
got

00:15:10:35 - 00:15:10:48
iron

00:15:10:48 - 00:15:11:36
Elixir

00:15:11:36 - 00:15:12:00
and

00:15:12:00 - 00:15:12:09
two

00:15:12:09 - 00:15:12:25
control

00:15:12:25 - 00:15:12:48
words.

00:15:14:00 - 00:15:14:21
Now.

00:15:14:54 - 00:15:15:01
All

00:15:15:01 - 00:15:15:07
right,

00:15:15:07 - 00:15:15:12
here

00:15:15:12 - 00:15:15:21
we go.

00:15:15:21 - 00:15:15:25
Here

00:15:15:25 - 00:15:15:37
we go.

00:15:15:37 - 00:15:15:43
Here

00:15:15:43 - 00:15:16:15
we go.

00:15:16:22 - 00:15:16:37
I don't

00:15:16:37 - 00:15:16:49
play it.

00:15:16:49 - 00:15:16:55
And

00:15:16:55 - 00:15:17:01
then

00:15:17:01 - 00:15:17:20
we go

00:15:17:20 - 00:15:17:33
right

00:15:17:33 - 00:15:17:57
into

00:15:17:57 - 00:15:18:48
Messi.

00:15:19:40 - 00:15:19:52
Yeah,

00:15:19:55 - 00:15:20:04
that's

00:15:20:04 - 00:15:20:15
what I

00:15:20:15 - 00:15:20:22
think

00:15:20:22 - 00:15:20:29
of

00:15:20:29 - 00:15:20:47
Jeremy

00:15:20:47 - 00:15:21:00
out of

00:15:21:00 - 00:15:21:45
coin.

00:15:21:45 - 00:15:21:57
I think

00:15:21:57 - 00:15:22:03
it's

00:15:22:03 - 00:15:22:44
very bad

00:15:22:44 - 00:15:22:53
that

00:15:22:53 - 00:15:23:00
he's

00:15:23:00 - 00:15:23:11
not

00:15:23:11 - 00:15:23:38
there,

00:15:23:38 - 00:15:23:52
to be

00:15:23:52 - 00:15:24:50
honest.

00:15:26:39 - 00:15:26:49
Need

00:15:26:49 - 00:15:27:09
to not

00:15:27:09 - 00:15:27:18
get

00:15:27:18 - 00:15:28:15
poked

00:15:30:03 - 00:15:30:12
while

00:15:30:12 - 00:15:30:21
they're

00:15:30:21 - 00:15:30:36
higher

00:15:30:36 - 00:15:30:50
base

00:15:30:50 - 00:15:31:01
level

00:15:31:01 - 00:15:31:10
than

00:15:31:10 - 00:15:31:17
us.

00:15:31:17 - 00:15:31:46
What?

00:15:52:22 - 00:15:52:31
I'm

00:15:52:31 - 00:15:52:40
just

00:15:52:40 - 00:15:52:51
trying

00:15:52:51 - 00:15:52:55
to

00:15:52:55 - 00:15:53:11
scare

00:15:53:11 - 00:15:53:36
them.

00:16:04:55 - 00:16:06:07
Nice.

00:16:08:13 - 00:16:08:38
He had to go

00:16:08:38 - 00:16:08:43
in

00:16:08:43 - 00:16:09:41
blind.

00:16:11:20 - 00:16:11:45
Okay.

00:16:11:45 - 00:16:12:01
I think

00:16:12:01 - 00:16:12:09
that

00:16:12:09 - 00:16:12:12
we

00:16:12:12 - 00:16:12:23
just

00:16:12:23 - 00:16:12:30
go

00:16:12:30 - 00:16:13:06
bottom.

00:16:13:06 - 00:16:13:35
I think

00:16:13:35 - 00:16:13:57
all of us

00:16:13:57 - 00:16:14:06
just

00:16:14:06 - 00:16:14:12

00:16:23:52 - 00:16:24:09

00:16:24:09 - 00:16:24:19

00:16:24:19 - 00:16:24:59

00:16:26:27 - 00:16:26:36
I'm

00:16:26:36 - 00:16:26:43
going

00:16:26:43 - 00:16:26:54

00:16:26:54 - 00:16:27:23

00:22:58:10 - 00:22:58:21
like

00:22:58:21 - 00:22:58:39
Brock

00:22:58:39 - 00:22:59:40
Lesnar

00:22:59:58 - 00:23:00:19

Window

00:23:00:59 - 00:23:01:41
J

00:23:04:17 - 00:23:04:53
Oh

00:23:04:53 - 00:23:06:16
God,

00:23:06:25 - 00:23:06:45
they're

00:23:06:45 - 00:23:06:57
going

00:23:06:57 - 00:23:07:08
to be

00:23:07:08 - 00:23:07:12
a

00:23:07:12 - 00:23:07:48
jungle

00:23:09:10 - 00:23:09:50
jungle.

00:23:09:50 - 00:23:10:02
So

00:23:10:02 - 00:23:10:57
it was going

00:23:10:57 - 00:23:11:04
to be

00:23:11:04 - 00:23:11:36
a jungle guy

00:23:11:36 - 00:23:11:56
because

00:23:11:56 - 00:23:13:08
the deadline

00:23:13:08 - 00:23:13:19
had

00:23:13:19 - 00:23:13:31
come

00:23:13:31 - 00:23:13:46
to do

00:23:13:46 - 00:23:14:15

I'm

00:23:27:50 - 00:23:28:10
the dog.

00:23:28:10 - 00:23:28:40
All the cast

00:23:28:40 - 00:23:28:49

Okay,

00:23:29:47 - 00:23:30:01
So

00:23:30:01 - 00:23:30:23
excited

00:23:30:23 - 00:23:30:48
to be here

00:23:30:48 - 00:23:31:03
about

00:23:31:03 - 00:23:31:26
especially

00:23:31:26 - 00:23:31:40
we get

00:23:31:40 - 00:23:31:44
to

00:23:31:44 - 00:23:32:04
cast

00:23:32:04 - 00:23:32:15
out

00:23:32:15 - 00:23:32:31
yells

00:23:32:31 - 00:23:32:40
team

00:23:32:40 - 00:23:32:45
to

00:23:32:45 - 00:23:33:00
start it

00:23:33:00 - 00:23:33:12
off.

00:23:33:12 - 00:23:33:25
What's

00:23:33:25 - 00:23:33:54
more

00:23:34:03 - 00:23:34:17
like

00:23:34:17 - 00:23:34:54
the reunion

00:23:34:54 - 00:23:35:18
but I

00:23:35:18 - 00:23:35:25
can

00:23:35:25 - 00:23:35:38
open

00:23:35:38 - 00:23:35:42
the

00:23:35:42 - 00:23:35:54
window.

00:23:35:54 - 00:23:36:01
It's

00:23:36:01 - 00:23:36:19
so hot

00:23:36:19 - 00:23:36:37
once I

00:23:37:53 - 00:23:38:13
especially

00:23:38:13 - 00:23:38:18
it's

00:23:38:18 - 00:23:38:27
got to

00:23:38:27 - 00:23:38:36
l

00:23:38:36 - 00:23:38:58
pointed

00:23:38:58 - 00:23:39:19
out

00:23:39:36 - 00:23:40:10
to the

00:23:40:10 - 00:23:41:11
international stage

00:23:41:11 - 00:23:41:18
you're

00:23:41:18 - 00:23:41:31
looking

00:23:41:31 - 00:23:41:42
for

00:23:41:42 - 00:23:41:54
show

00:23:41:54 - 00:23:41:58
shouldn't

00:23:41:58 - 00:23:42:09
use

00:23:42:09 - 00:23:42:12
the

00:23:42:12 - 00:23:42:57
international stage.

00:23:42:57 - 00:23:43:24
I want to see

00:23:43:24 - 00:23:43:30
what

00:23:43:30 - 00:23:43:51
these guys

00:23:43:51 - 00:23:43:58
have

00:23:43:58 - 00:23:44:04
to

00:23:44:04 - 00:23:44:20
offer.

00:23:44:20 - 00:23:44:33
Yeah,

00:23:44:33 - 00:23:44:36
it

00:23:44:36 - 00:23:44:58
definitely.

00:23:44:58 - 00:23:45:18
I

00:23:45:18 - 00:23:45:27
mean,

00:23:45:27 - 00:23:46:01
PLG,

00:23:46:01 - 00:23:46:15
as an

00:23:46:15 - 00:23:46:57
organization

00:23:46:57 - 00:23:47:09
new

00:23:47:09 - 00:23:47:20
to the

00:23:47:20 - 00:23:48:03
international stage,

00:23:48:03 - 00:23:48:16
I think

00:23:48:16 - 00:23:48:30
a lot of

00:23:48:30 - 00:23:48:50
people

00:23:48:50 - 00:23:49:04
coming

00:23:49:04 - 00:23:49:12
in

00:23:49:12 - 00:23:49:55
saying,

00:23:49:55 - 00:23:50:02
you

00:23:50:02 - 00:23:50:21
know,

00:23:50:21 - 00:23:50:43
BLT,

00:23:50:43 - 00:23:50:49
the

00:23:50:49 - 00:23:51:14
favorite

00:23:51:14 - 00:23:51:34
today.

00:23:51:34 - 00:23:51:41
And

00:23:51:41 - 00:23:51:55
I think

00:23:51:55 - 00:23:52:08
that's

00:23:52:08 - 00:23:52:26
a fair

00:23:52:26 - 00:23:52:46
statement

00:23:52:46 - 00:23:52:53
to

00:23:52:53 - 00:23:53:27
make.

00:23:53:27 - 00:23:53:42
But

00:23:53:42 - 00:23:53:58
all

00:23:53:58 - 00:23:54:19
seven

00:23:54:19 - 00:23:54:46
attempts

00:23:54:46 - 00:23:54:52
at

00:23:54:52 - 00:23:55:57
organizational

00:23:55:57 - 00:23:57:07
representation,

00:23:57:07 - 00:23:57:50
they've been

00:23:57:50 - 00:23:57:59
to

00:23:57:59 - 00:23:58:39
internationals

00:23:58:39 - 00:23:59:00
before.

00:23:59:00 - 00:23:59:33
PLG

00:23:59:33 - 00:23:59:51
This is

00:23:59:51 - 00:24:00:01
their

00:24:00:01 - 00:24:00:50
first

00:24:00:50 - 00:24:01:30
time

00:24:01:30 - 00:24:02:04
ever

00:24:02:04 - 00:24:02:20
as an

00:24:02:20 - 00:24:02:54
organization.

00:24:02:54 - 00:24:03:01
But

00:24:03:01 - 00:24:03:18
straight

00:24:03:18 - 00:24:03:25
off

00:24:03:25 - 00:24:03:55
the bat,

00:24:03:55 - 00:24:04:19
we've got

00:24:04:19 - 00:24:04:22
a

00:24:04:22 - 00:24:04:46
Draven

00:24:04:46 - 00:24:05:11
band

00:24:05:11 - 00:24:06:07
pulled on it,

00:24:06:07 - 00:24:06:21
and

00:24:06:21 - 00:24:06:36
that's

00:24:06:36 - 00:24:06:48
not

00:24:06:48 - 00:24:07:22
surprising,

00:24:07:22 - 00:24:07:35
really.

00:24:07:35 - 00:24:07:58
See

00:24:08:02 - 00:24:08:18
you on

00:24:08:18 - 00:24:08:31
the other

00:24:08:31 - 00:24:09:09
side.

00:24:09:09 - 00:24:09:18
I'm

00:24:09:18 - 00:24:09:32
curious

00:24:09:32 - 00:24:09:43
to see

00:24:09:43 - 00:24:10:04
exactly

00:24:10:04 - 00:24:10:12
what

00:24:10:12 - 00:24:10:15
the

00:24:10:15 - 00:24:10:28
band's

00:24:10:28 - 00:24:10:36
going

00:24:10:36 - 00:24:10:49
to be

00:24:10:49 - 00:24:11:06
against

00:24:11:06 - 00:24:11:33
PLG,

00:24:11:33 - 00:24:11:43
though,

00:24:11:43 - 00:24:12:09
because

00:24:12:09 - 00:24:12:28
we saw it

00:24:12:28 - 00:24:12:34
in

00:24:12:34 - 00:24:12:48
Italy

00:24:12:48 - 00:24:13:06
come out

00:24:13:06 - 00:24:13:35
yesterday.

00:24:13:35 - 00:24:13:48
We know

00:24:13:48 - 00:24:14:00
Sean

00:24:14:00 - 00:24:14:07
is a

00:24:14:07 - 00:24:14:36
big

00:24:14:40 - 00:24:15:19
player,

00:24:15:19 - 00:24:15:21
a

00:24:15:21 - 00:24:15:59
lot of respect

00:24:15:59 - 00:24:16:12
given

00:24:16:12 - 00:24:16:26
to his

00:24:16:26 - 00:24:16:46
kindred

00:24:16:46 - 00:24:16:57
over

00:24:16:57 - 00:24:17:47
the LPL.

00:24:17:47 - 00:24:18:14
The needle

00:24:18:14 - 00:24:18:21
as

00:24:18:21 - 00:24:18:32
well

00:24:18:32 - 00:24:18:37
has

00:24:18:37 - 00:24:18:48
always

00:24:18:48 - 00:24:18:55
been

00:24:18:55 - 00:24:19:10
something

00:24:19:10 - 00:24:19:15
that

00:24:19:15 - 00:24:19:31
he's

00:24:19:31 - 00:24:19:48
had in

00:24:19:48 - 00:24:19:53
his

00:24:19:53 - 00:24:20:18
wheelhouse.

00:24:20:18 - 00:24:20:49
So I'm

00:24:20:49 - 00:24:21:05
curious

00:24:21:05 - 00:24:21:14
to see

00:24:21:14 - 00:24:21:19
if

00:24:21:19 - 00:24:21:45
we do

00:24:21:45 - 00:24:21:57
get

00:24:21:57 - 00:24:22:08
these

00:24:22:08 - 00:24:22:16
more

00:24:22:16 - 00:24:22:36
carry

00:24:22:36 - 00:24:23:00
oriented

00:24:23:00 - 00:24:23:18
junglers

00:24:23:18 - 00:24:23:30
coming

00:24:23:30 - 00:24:23:37
out

00:24:23:37 - 00:24:24:00
for,

00:24:24:10 - 00:24:24:18
well,

00:24:24:18 - 00:24:24:27
let's

00:24:24:27 - 00:24:24:39
see

00:24:24:39 - 00:24:24:45
where

00:24:24:45 - 00:24:25:06
the jungle

00:24:25:06 - 00:24:25:17
pull

00:24:25:17 - 00:24:25:49
goes

00:24:25:49 - 00:24:26:06
as I'm

00:24:26:06 - 00:24:26:13
going

00:24:26:13 - 00:24:26:16
to

00:24:26:16 - 00:24:26:29
wade

00:24:26:29 - 00:24:26:42
back,

00:24:26:42 - 00:24:26:57
ask

00:24:26:57 - 00:24:27:24
him.

00:24:27:59 - 00:24:28:17
Okay.

00:24:28:17 - 00:24:28:33
Okay.

00:24:28:33 - 00:24:28:41
We're

00:24:28:41 - 00:24:29:04
undrafted.

00:24:29:04 - 00:24:29:47
Undrafted.

00:24:30:05 - 00:24:30:14
Yeah.

00:24:30:14 - 00:24:30:27
I don't

00:24:30:27 - 00:24:30:32
know

00:24:30:32 - 00:24:30:39
where

00:24:30:39 - 00:24:30:55
everyone

00:24:30:55 - 00:24:31:04
is.

00:24:31:04 - 00:24:31:08
Oh,

00:24:31:08 - 00:24:31:15
my

00:24:31:15 - 00:24:31:24
God,

00:24:31:24 - 00:24:31:32
What

00:24:31:32 - 00:24:31:42
the hell

00:24:31:42 - 00:24:31:46
is

00:24:31:46 - 00:24:31:57
going

00:24:31:57 - 00:24:32:18
on?

00:24:32:27 - 00:24:32:43
But

00:24:32:43 - 00:24:33:07
one

00:24:33:07 - 00:24:33:21
that.

00:24:33:36 - 00:24:34:06
Okay,

00:24:34:10 - 00:24:35:25
Draven,

00:24:35:29 - 00:24:36:18
Silas

00:24:36:18 - 00:24:36:36
and

00:24:36:36 - 00:24:37:15
VI.

00:24:37:15 - 00:24:37:55
Okay,

00:24:38:06 - 00:24:38:27
but

00:24:38:27 - 00:24:38:36
it's

00:24:38:36 - 00:24:38:42
as

00:24:38:42 - 00:24:39:05
simple

00:24:39:05 - 00:24:39:39
as that.

00:24:39:39 - 00:24:39:46
But

00:24:39:46 - 00:24:40:26
the Kindred,

00:24:40:26 - 00:24:40:44
Take

00:24:40:44 - 00:24:40:48
it

00:24:40:48 - 00:24:41:02
away

00:24:41:02 - 00:24:41:16
from

00:24:41:16 - 00:24:41:31
Sean.

00:24:41:31 - 00:24:41:40
Like

00:24:41:40 - 00:24:41:43
you

00:24:41:43 - 00:24:41:54
said,

00:24:41:54 - 00:24:42:00
the

00:24:42:00 - 00:24:42:39
carry

00:24:42:39 - 00:24:43:42
junglers

00:24:43:42 - 00:24:43:57
at

00:24:43:57 - 00:24:44:16
least

00:24:44:16 - 00:24:44:38
still

00:24:44:38 - 00:24:44:54
open.

00:24:44:54 - 00:24:45:00
And

00:24:45:00 - 00:24:45:14
we saw

00:24:46:37 - 00:24:47:09
guys.

00:24:47:09 - 00:24:47:24
Good.

00:24:47:24 - 00:24:47:40
Be

00:24:48:03 - 00:24:48:45
ready.

00:24:48:45 - 00:24:49:15
Nautilus

00:24:49:15 - 00:24:49:22
is

00:24:49:22 - 00:24:49:51
back.

00:24:49:51 - 00:24:50:04
There

00:24:50:04 - 00:24:50:18
it is.

00:24:50:18 - 00:24:50:42
The

00:24:50:42 - 00:24:51:18
Nautilus.

00:24:51:18 - 00:24:51:45
Nautilus

00:24:51:45 - 00:24:51:54
for

00:24:51:54 - 00:24:52:01
you,

00:24:52:01 - 00:24:52:17
gal.

00:24:52:17 - 00:24:52:22
And

00:24:52:22 - 00:24:52:42
then

00:24:52:42 - 00:24:53:00
we got

00:24:53:00 - 00:24:53:24
B1

00:24:53:24 - 00:24:54:10
Nautilus

00:24:54:10 - 00:24:54:14
as

00:24:54:14 - 00:24:54:27
well.

00:24:54:27 - 00:24:54:48
So.

00:24:54:48 - 00:24:55:33
Okay.

00:24:55:33 - 00:24:55:44
How's

00:24:55:44 - 00:24:55:53
it in

00:24:55:53 - 00:24:56:07
the back

00:24:56:07 - 00:24:56:22
pocket

00:24:56:22 - 00:24:56:27
as

00:24:56:27 - 00:24:56:36
well?

00:24:56:36 - 00:24:56:42
It's

00:24:56:42 - 00:24:57:36
put into the middle,

00:24:57:36 - 00:24:58:15
although.

00:24:58:15 - 00:24:58:37
All right,

00:24:58:37 - 00:24:58:46
let's

00:24:58:46 - 00:24:59:13
fucking out

00:24:59:13 - 00:24:59:34
in.

00:25:00:07 - 00:25:00:21
Oh

00:25:00:21 - 00:25:00:32
yeah.

00:25:00:32 - 00:25:00:39
I

00:25:00:39 - 00:25:00:48
can

00:25:00:48 - 00:25:00:55
read

00:25:00:55 - 00:25:01:01
the

00:25:01:01 - 00:25:01:18
text.

00:25:01:18 - 00:25:01:37
Yeah.

00:25:02:11 - 00:25:02:27
Yeah.

00:25:02:27 - 00:25:02:36
They're

00:25:02:36 - 00:25:02:52
saying

00:25:02:52 - 00:25:02:58
you

00:25:02:58 - 00:25:03:07
want

00:25:03:07 - 00:25:03:11
to

00:25:03:11 - 00:25:03:27
stroke

00:25:03:27 - 00:25:04:03
TV.

00:25:04:03 - 00:25:04:13
Well

00:25:04:13 - 00:25:04:28
we've

00:25:04:28 - 00:25:04:39
got

00:25:04:39 - 00:25:05:36
one as

00:25:05:36 - 00:25:05:52
well,

00:25:05:52 - 00:25:06:06
but.

00:25:06:14 - 00:25:06:49
Okay,

00:25:06:55 - 00:25:06:59
I'm

00:25:06:59 - 00:25:07:17
laying

00:25:07:17 - 00:25:07:49
there

00:25:07:49 - 00:25:08:09
from

00:25:08:09 - 00:25:08:36
on

00:25:08:42 - 00:25:09:00
being

00:25:09:00 - 00:25:09:23
versus

00:25:09:23 - 00:25:10:08
bong

00:25:10:08 - 00:25:10:15
go

00:25:10:15 - 00:25:10:21
for

00:25:10:21 - 00:25:10:28
that

00:25:10:28 - 00:25:10:51
jungle

00:25:10:51 - 00:25:11:04
fight.

00:25:11:04 - 00:25:11:18
Looks

00:25:11:18 - 00:25:11:31
things

00:25:11:31 - 00:25:11:38
that

00:25:11:38 - 00:25:11:54
work

00:25:11:54 - 00:25:12:04
on

00:25:12:04 - 00:25:12:36
fairly

00:25:12:36 - 00:25:13:03
standard

00:25:13:03 - 00:25:13:10
on

00:25:13:10 - 00:25:13:30
the side

00:25:13:30 - 00:25:13:40
of our

00:25:13:40 - 00:25:14:02
set.

00:25:14:07 - 00:25:14:15
It's

00:25:14:15 - 00:25:14:27
fairly

00:25:14:27 - 00:25:14:43
standard

00:25:14:43 - 00:25:14:49
on

00:25:14:49 - 00:25:15:01
both

00:25:15:01 - 00:25:15:28
sides.

00:25:15:28 - 00:25:16:08
Okay.

00:25:16:08 - 00:25:16:53
Mm.

00:25:16:53 - 00:25:17:07
He's

00:25:17:07 - 00:25:18:14
definitely

00:25:18:14 - 00:25:18:21
going

00:25:18:21 - 00:25:18:30
to be

00:25:18:30 - 00:25:18:48
late.

00:25:18:48 - 00:25:19:33
We could see

00:25:19:33 - 00:25:19:40
it.

00:25:19:53 - 00:25:20:29
Lucian

00:25:20:29 - 00:25:21:00
NAMI.

00:25:21:00 - 00:25:21:43
Okay.

00:25:21:43 - 00:25:22:04
Saw

00:25:22:04 - 00:25:22:12
that.

00:25:22:12 - 00:25:22:19
No

00:25:22:19 - 00:25:22:31
obvious

00:25:22:31 - 00:25:22:48
jungle

00:25:22:48 - 00:25:23:07
could be a

00:25:23:07 - 00:25:23:43
thing.

00:25:23:43 - 00:25:23:52
Yeah.

00:25:23:52 - 00:25:24:14
I mean

00:25:24:14 - 00:25:24:32
I think

00:25:24:32 - 00:25:24:43
it was

00:25:24:43 - 00:25:25:46
actually obvious.

00:25:25:46 - 00:25:25:53
So

00:25:25:53 - 00:25:25:57
I

00:25:25:57 - 00:25:26:09
guess

00:25:26:09 - 00:25:26:29
it is,

00:25:26:29 - 00:25:27:01
it is

00:25:27:01 - 00:25:27:09
going

00:25:27:09 - 00:25:27:19
to be

00:25:27:19 - 00:25:27:45
mid

00:25:27:45 - 00:25:27:56
and

00:25:27:56 - 00:25:28:08
all of

00:25:28:08 - 00:25:28:33
us

00:25:29:16 - 00:25:29:27
pick

00:25:29:27 - 00:25:29:38
away

00:25:29:38 - 00:25:29:49
there

00:25:29:49 - 00:25:30:25
from him

00:25:30:25 - 00:25:30:34
and

00:25:30:34 - 00:25:30:41
then

00:25:30:41 - 00:25:31:01
Lucian

00:25:31:01 - 00:25:31:15
Ami

00:25:31:15 - 00:25:31:31
Dude

00:25:31:31 - 00:25:31:42
this

00:25:31:42 - 00:25:31:53
game

00:25:31:53 - 00:25:31:57
is

00:25:31:57 - 00:25:32:31
going to be

00:25:32:31 - 00:25:32:54
this game is

00:25:32:54 - 00:25:33:01
going

00:25:33:01 - 00:25:33:12
to be

00:25:33:12 - 00:25:33:30
a 20

00:25:33:30 - 00:25:33:45
minute

00:25:33:45 - 00:25:34:46
tournament.

00:25:34:48 - 00:25:35:29
This is not

00:25:35:29 - 00:25:35:38
going

00:25:35:38 - 00:25:35:47
to be

00:25:35:47 - 00:25:36:03
close

00:25:36:03 - 00:25:36:09
at

00:25:36:09 - 00:25:36:34
all.

00:25:36:42 - 00:25:36:52
Does

00:25:36:52 - 00:25:37:01
not

00:25:37:01 - 00:25:37:10
always

00:25:37:10 - 00:25:37:21
have

00:25:37:21 - 00:25:37:33
more

00:25:37:33 - 00:25:37:42
than

00:25:37:42 - 00:25:38:51
one type.

00:25:38:52 - 00:25:39:16
I mean

00:25:39:16 - 00:25:39:54
I guess

00:25:39:54 - 00:25:40:13
he can

00:25:40:13 - 00:25:40:40
he can

00:25:40:40 - 00:25:40:58
he can

00:25:40:58 - 00:25:41:16
pull

00:25:41:16 - 00:25:41:22
and

00:25:41:22 - 00:25:42:00
disengage.

00:25:42:00 - 00:25:42:18
He doesn't

00:25:42:18 - 00:25:42:28
just

00:25:42:28 - 00:25:42:46
always

00:25:42:46 - 00:25:42:55
have

00:25:42:55 - 00:25:43:03
to

00:25:43:03 - 00:25:43:25
engage.

00:25:43:25 - 00:25:43:50
Yeah,

00:25:44:09 - 00:25:44:25
he can

00:25:44:25 - 00:25:44:36
like

00:25:44:36 - 00:25:44:51
just

00:25:44:51 - 00:25:45:07
press.

00:25:45:07 - 00:25:45:27
Ah,

00:25:45:27 - 00:25:45:36
and

00:25:45:36 - 00:25:45:45
then

00:25:45:45 - 00:25:45:57
use

00:25:45:57 - 00:25:46:21
everything

00:25:46:21 - 00:25:46:33
else

00:25:46:33 - 00:25:46:40
to

00:25:46:40 - 00:25:46:53
play

00:25:46:53 - 00:25:47:02
with

00:25:47:02 - 00:25:47:24
passive

00:25:47:24 - 00:25:47:29
and.

00:25:47:29 - 00:25:47:51
Q

00:25:47:51 - 00:25:48:09
Is

00:25:48:09 - 00:25:48:21
that

00:25:48:21 - 00:25:48:34
better

00:25:49:46 - 00:25:49:58
and

00:25:49:58 - 00:25:50:51
especially

00:25:50:51 - 00:25:51:14
good,

00:25:51:14 - 00:25:51:41
more

00:25:51:41 - 00:25:52:49
incomings

00:25:52:49 - 00:25:53:04
Now

00:25:53:04 - 00:25:53:15
we're not

00:25:53:15 - 00:25:53:24
going

00:25:53:24 - 00:25:53:34
to see

00:25:53:34 - 00:25:53:43
more

00:25:53:43 - 00:25:54:30
Kizer,

00:25:54:30 - 00:25:54:39
but

00:25:54:39 - 00:25:54:54
also

00:25:54:54 - 00:25:55:04
just

00:25:55:04 - 00:25:55:17
take

00:25:55:17 - 00:25:55:21
it

00:25:55:21 - 00:25:55:30
away,

00:25:55:30 - 00:25:55:42
I think

00:25:55:42 - 00:25:55:51
more

00:25:55:51 - 00:25:55:55
of

00:25:55:55 - 00:25:56:11
Kizer

00:25:56:11 - 00:25:56:43
on our three

00:25:56:43 - 00:25:56:49
and

00:25:56:49 - 00:25:56:56
then

00:25:56:56 - 00:25:57:14
Ben

00:25:57:14 - 00:25:58:01
Fiora

00:25:58:01 - 00:25:58:28
is

00:25:58:28 - 00:25:58:58
probably

00:25:58:58 - 00:25:59:52
fine

00:26:01:40 - 00:26:01:53
that

00:26:01:53 - 00:26:01:59
way.

00:26:01:59 - 00:26:02:09
Don't

00:26:02:09 - 00:26:02:15
have

00:26:02:15 - 00:26:02:33
flex

00:26:02:33 - 00:26:03:01
on

00:26:03:09 - 00:26:03:27
Yeah,

00:26:04:15 - 00:26:05:02
now

00:26:05:02 - 00:26:05:13
Yeah,

00:26:05:13 - 00:26:05:22
it's a

00:26:05:22 - 00:26:05:31
three

00:26:05:31 - 00:26:05:38
way

00:26:05:38 - 00:26:05:58
flex

00:26:05:58 - 00:26:06:41
in theory

00:26:06:41 - 00:26:07:13
he has

00:26:07:21 - 00:26:08:13
to mid

00:26:08:13 - 00:26:08:24
mid

00:26:08:24 - 00:26:08:42
jungle

00:26:08:42 - 00:26:09:05
sub

00:26:09:05 - 00:26:09:28
fairly

00:26:09:28 - 00:26:09:50
decent.

00:26:09:50 - 00:26:09:55
He's

00:26:09:55 - 00:26:10:04
not

00:26:10:04 - 00:26:10:17
lined

00:26:10:17 - 00:26:10:24
up

00:26:10:24 - 00:26:10:40
a few

00:26:10:40 - 00:26:10:44
of

00:26:10:44 - 00:26:11:06
those

00:26:11:18 - 00:26:11:34
probably

00:26:11:34 - 00:26:11:43
can't

00:26:11:43 - 00:26:12:01
go to

00:26:12:01 - 00:26:12:14
I mean

00:26:12:14 - 00:26:12:18
it

00:26:12:18 - 00:26:12:27
can't

00:26:12:27 - 00:26:12:32
go

00:26:12:32 - 00:26:12:57
toppling

00:26:12:57 - 00:26:13:04
but

00:26:13:04 - 00:26:13:30
yeah

00:26:13:37 - 00:26:13:57
I think

00:26:13:57 - 00:26:14:06
what's

00:26:14:06 - 00:26:14:09
the

00:26:14:09 - 00:26:14:16
best

00:26:14:16 - 00:26:14:36
kind

00:26:14:36 - 00:26:14:40

med.

00:26:15:37 - 00:26:15:54
I think

00:26:15:54 - 00:26:15:59
you're

00:26:15:59 - 00:26:16:12
looking

00:26:16:12 - 00:26:16:17
at

00:26:16:17 - 00:26:16:28
like

00:26:16:28 - 00:26:17:06

00:26:17:06 - 00:26:17:31

00:26:17:31 - 00:26:18:32
and

00:26:18:32 - 00:26:19:03
Swain

00:26:19:03 - 00:26:19:53
set

00:26:19:53 - 00:26:20:07
wants

00:26:20:07 - 00:26:20:18
to

00:26:20:29 - 00:26:20:40
and

00:26:20:40 - 00:26:21:23

Kaiser

00:26:22:28 - 00:26:22:33
That

00:26:22:33 - 00:26:22:46
makes

00:26:22:46 - 00:26:22:57
a lot

00:26:22:57 - 00:26:23:00
of

00:26:23:00 - 00:26:23:33
sense.

00:26:23:33 - 00:26:23:38
The

00:26:23:38 - 00:26:24:08
big question

00:26:24:08 - 00:26:24:21
yeah

00:26:24:21 - 00:26:24:39
could be

00:26:24:39 - 00:26:24:45
it

00:26:24:45 - 00:26:24:52
could

00:26:24:52 - 00:26:25:05
be not

00:26:25:05 - 00:26:25:13
was

00:26:25:13 - 00:26:25:28
jungle

00:26:25:28 - 00:26:25:42
Yeah

00:26:25:42 - 00:26:25:53
they

00:26:25:53 - 00:26:26:11
leave

00:26:26:11 - 00:26:26:16
the

00:26:26:16 - 00:26:26:33
character

00:26:26:33 - 00:26:26:43
big

00:26:26:43 - 00:26:27:12
for long

00:26:27:12 - 00:26:27:34
I think

00:26:27:34 - 00:26:27:39
you

00:26:27:39 - 00:26:28:03
kind

00:26:28:03 - 00:26:28:06
of

00:26:28:06 - 00:26:28:17
need

00:26:28:17 - 00:26:28:26
to

00:26:28:26 - 00:26:28:30
if

00:26:28:30 - 00:26:28:35
you're

00:26:28:35 - 00:26:28:44
going

00:26:28:44 - 00:26:28:51
up

00:26:28:51 - 00:26:29:04
against

Ben.

00:26:29:33 - 00:26:29:57
Just

00:26:30:03 - 00:26:30:16
what's

00:26:30:16 - 00:26:30:21
the

00:26:30:21 - 00:26:30:57
best.

00:26:30:57 - 00:26:31:18
Yeah,

00:26:31:30 - 00:26:31:51
yeah,

00:26:31:51 - 00:26:32:06
yeah.

00:26:32:06 - 00:26:32:31
Especially

00:26:32:31 - 00:26:33:05
since

00:26:33:05 - 00:26:33:23
both

00:26:33:23 - 00:26:33:30
of

00:26:33:30 - 00:26:33:41
these

00:26:33:41 - 00:26:33:57
players

00:26:33:57 - 00:26:34:05
from

scrimmage

00:26:35:00 - 00:26:35:15
G2.

00:26:35:15 - 00:26:35:47
It all

00:26:36:03 - 00:26:36:25
seem

00:26:36:25 - 00:26:36:54
like

00:26:36:57 - 00:26:37:12
you

00:26:37:12 - 00:26:37:48
anticipate

00:26:38:58 - 00:26:39:00
a

00:26:39:00 - 00:26:39:37
matchup

00:26:39:37 - 00:26:39:55
is

00:26:39:55 - 00:26:40:24
essentially

00:26:40:24 - 00:26:40:51
going to be

00:26:40:51 - 00:26:41:09
I guess

00:26:41:09 - 00:26:41:18
they

00:26:41:18 - 00:26:41:31

00:26:41:31 - 00:26:41:56

00:27:32:00 - 00:27:32:07
I

00:27:32:07 - 00:27:32:54
guess

00:27:32:54 - 00:27:33:05
if

00:27:33:05 - 00:27:33:10
your

00:27:33:10 - 00:27:33:21
team

00:27:33:21 - 00:27:33:39
really

00:27:33:39 - 00:27:33:57
likes

00:27:33:57 - 00:27:34:12

00:27:34:12 - 00:27:34:37

00:27:34:37 - 00:27:34:58
Yeah,

00:27:36:12 - 00:27:36:23
yeah,

00:27:36:23 - 00:27:36:28
I

00:27:36:28 - 00:27:36:38
guess

00:27:36:38 - 00:27:36:43
he

00:27:36:43 - 00:27:37:37
could

00:27:38:09 - 00:27:38:22
stop

00:27:38:22 - 00:27:38:27
with

00:27:38:27 - 00:27:38:31
the

00:27:38:31 - 00:27:39:28
treadmill.

00:27:39:28 - 00:27:40:10
I only stopped

00:27:40:10 - 00:27:40:28
because

00:27:40:28 - 00:27:40:37
of the

00:27:40:37 - 00:27:41:00
gourd

00:27:41:00 - 00:27:41:11
that

00:27:41:11 - 00:27:41:27
I had

00:27:41:27 - 00:27:41:36

00:27:41:36 - 00:27:41:45
like

00:27:41:45 - 00:27:42:10
two weeks,

00:27:42:10 - 00:27:42:18
but

00:27:42:18 - 00:27:42:27
now

00:27:42:27 - 00:27:42:34
it's

00:27:42:34 - 00:27:42:46
a lot

00:27:42:46 - 00:27:43:22
better.

00:27:43:24 - 00:27:43:46
I could

00:27:43:46 - 00:27:44:11
resume it,

00:27:44:11 - 00:27:44:22
but I

00:27:44:22 - 00:27:44:29
don't

00:27:44:29 - 00:27:44:42
want

00:27:44:42 - 00:27:44:49
to

00:27:44:49 - 00:27:44:56
right

00:27:44:56 - 00:27:45:25
now.

00:27:45:48 - 00:27:45:57

00:27:45:57 - 00:27:46:26
if you.

00:27:46:31 - 00:27:46:39

00:28:05:24 - 00:28:05:58
80%

00:28:05:58 - 00:28:06:07
weight

00:28:06:07 - 00:28:06:27
those aren't

00:28:06:27 - 00:28:06:37
bad

00:28:07:04 - 00:28:07:22
What I

00:28:07:22 - 00:28:07:31
thought

00:28:07:31 - 00:28:07:48
as Q

00:28:07:48 - 00:28:07:53
was

00:28:07:53 - 00:28:08:56
60%

00:28:08:56 - 00:28:09:03
is

00:28:09:03 - 00:28:09:57
aggressive

matchups

00:28:10:24 - 00:28:10:42
on the

00:28:10:51 - 00:28:10:58
boy.

00:28:10:58 - 00:28:11:11
That's

00:28:11:11 - 00:28:11:47
disgusting

00:28:11:47 - 00:28:12:00
then

00:28:12:00 - 00:28:12:14
yeah

00:28:12:14 - 00:28:12:27
he can

00:28:12:27 - 00:28:12:36
go

00:28:12:36 - 00:28:13:44
row them

00:28:14:00 - 00:28:14:11
That's

00:28:14:11 - 00:28:15:12
disgusting

00:28:15:12 - 00:28:15:28
weight

00:28:15:28 - 00:28:17:38
is 30%

00:28:17:38 - 00:28:17:49
who

00:28:17:49 - 00:28:18:00
won

00:28:18:00 - 00:28:18:46
drafts

00:28:18:48 - 00:28:19:08
I mean

00:28:19:08 - 00:28:20:04
Belge

00:28:20:04 - 00:28:20:45
Belge

00:28:20:45 - 00:28:21:16
definitely

00:28:21:16 - 00:28:21:21
you're

00:28:21:21 - 00:28:21:30
just

00:28:21:30 - 00:28:21:37
going

00:28:21:37 - 00:28:21:41
to

00:28:21:41 - 00:28:21:54
roll

00:28:21:54 - 00:28:22:22
them

00:28:22:46 - 00:28:23:11
PSG

00:28:23:11 - 00:28:23:18
are

00:28:23:18 - 00:28:23:56
absolutely

00:28:23:56 - 00:28:24:05
just

00:28:24:05 - 00:28:24:12
going

00:28:24:12 - 00:28:24:18
to

00:28:24:18 - 00:28:24:46
completely

00:28:24:46 - 00:28:25:03
pile

00:28:25:03 - 00:28:25:19
drive

00:28:25:19 - 00:28:25:37
them.

00:28:25:42 - 00:28:26:00
I think

00:28:26:00 - 00:28:26:11
if it

00:28:26:11 - 00:28:26:20
was a

00:28:26:20 - 00:28:26:36
top

00:28:26:36 - 00:28:26:47
team

00:28:26:47 - 00:28:27:07
versus

00:28:27:07 - 00:28:27:19
top

00:28:27:19 - 00:28:27:34
team,

00:28:27:34 - 00:28:27:45
our

00:28:27:45 - 00:28:28:03
seven

00:28:28:03 - 00:28:28:08
would

00:28:28:08 - 00:28:28:15
have

00:28:28:15 - 00:28:28:24
one

00:28:28:24 - 00:28:28:46
draft.

00:28:29:58 - 00:28:30:14
But I

00:28:30:14 - 00:28:30:25
think

00:28:30:25 - 00:28:30:34
that

00:28:30:34 - 00:28:30:57
like

00:28:30:57 - 00:28:31:13
this

00:28:31:13 - 00:28:31:30
draft

00:28:31:30 - 00:28:31:57
dynamic

00:28:31:57 - 00:28:32:11
build,

00:28:32:11 - 00:28:32:22
you're

00:28:32:22 - 00:28:32:31
just

00:28:32:31 - 00:28:32:38
going

00:28:32:38 - 00:28:32:51
to run

00:28:32:51 - 00:28:33:00
them

00:28:33:00 - 00:28:33:12
over

00:28:33:12 - 00:28:33:36
so hard

00:28:33:36 - 00:28:33:50
not to

00:28:33:50 - 00:28:33:59
pick

00:28:33:59 - 00:28:34:13
some

00:28:34:15 - 00:28:34:21
that

00:28:34:21 - 00:28:34:30
you

00:28:34:30 - 00:28:34:46
haven't

00:28:34:46 - 00:28:34:55
seen

00:28:34:55 - 00:28:35:15
before,

00:28:35:15 - 00:28:35:27
right?

00:28:35:27 - 00:28:36:03
Jagow

00:28:36:03 - 00:28:36:52
Hasn't

00:28:36:52 - 00:28:37:08
he has

00:28:37:08 - 00:28:37:34
50.

00:28:37:34 - 00:28:37:46
Yeah,

00:28:37:46 - 00:28:37:57
those

00:28:37:57 - 00:28:38:04
aren't

00:28:38:04 - 00:28:38:13
bad

00:28:38:13 - 00:28:38:34
ratios

00:28:38:34 - 00:28:38:56
then.

00:28:39:05 - 00:28:39:50
20

00:28:39:50 - 00:28:40:04

00:28:41:54 - 00:28:42:05
this

00:28:42:05 - 00:28:42:23
one.

00:28:42:23 - 00:28:42:55
Yeah,

00:28:42:55 - 00:28:43:06
and

00:28:43:06 - 00:28:43:21
you have

00:28:43:21 - 00:28:43:26
to

00:28:43:26 - 00:28:43:55
question

00:28:43:55 - 00:28:44:16

00:28:44:58 - 00:28:45:43
Some guy was hot

00:28:45:43 - 00:28:46:03
because

00:28:46:03 - 00:28:46:19
he has

00:28:46:19 - 00:28:46:33
always

00:28:46:33 - 00:28:46:42
been

00:28:47:52 - 00:28:48:01

00:28:48:01 - 00:28:48:12
he have

00:28:51:27 - 00:28:52:21

Okay.

00:29:34:28 - 00:29:34:39

00:29:34:39 - 00:29:35:40
This is ridiculous.

00:29:37:19 - 00:29:37:32
like

00:29:37:32 - 00:29:37:37
I'm

00:29:37:37 - 00:29:37:44

00:29:38:16 - 00:29:38:20
in

00:29:38:20 - 00:29:38:58
the overlap

00:29:38:58 - 00:29:39:05
that

00:29:39:05 - 00:29:39:32
we just

00:29:39:32 - 00:29:39:57
have.

00:29:40:01 - 00:29:40:17
Okay,

00:29:40:17 - 00:29:40:24
here

00:29:40:24 - 00:29:40:34
we go.

00:29:40:34 - 00:29:40:42
Here

00:29:40:42 - 00:29:40:57
we go.

00:29:40:57 - 00:29:41:04
Here

00:29:41:04 - 00:29:41:27
we go.

00:29:41:27 - 00:29:41:56
It's

00:29:42:01 - 00:29:42:12
yeah.

00:29:42:12 - 00:29:42:23
So

00:29:42:23 - 00:29:42:30
he'll

00:29:42:30 - 00:29:42:39
be

00:29:42:39 - 00:29:42:48
here

00:29:42:48 - 00:29:43:01
in an

00:29:43:01 - 00:29:43:15
hour

00:29:43:15 - 00:29:43:22
is

00:29:43:22 - 00:29:43:40
what

00:29:43:40 - 00:29:43:53
that's

00:29:43:53 - 00:29:44:02
what

00:29:44:02 - 00:29:44:07
we

00:29:44:07 - 00:29:44:51
prayed

00:29:44:51 - 00:29:45:37
national.

00:29:45:37 - 00:29:45:48
He's

00:29:45:48 - 00:29:45:57
on

00:29:45:57 - 00:29:46:28
vacation,

00:29:46:28 - 00:29:46:37
though.

00:29:46:37 - 00:29:47:36
Not anymore

00:29:47:36 - 00:29:47:51
since

00:29:47:51 - 00:29:48:03
that

00:29:48:03 - 00:29:49:26
first time

00:29:49:26 - 00:29:49:37
but

00:29:49:37 - 00:29:49:46
he's

00:29:49:46 - 00:29:49:57
on

00:29:49:57 - 00:29:50:25
vacation.

00:29:50:25 - 00:29:50:38
He says

00:29:50:38 - 00:29:50:49
he has

00:29:50:49 - 00:29:51:30
meetings.

00:29:51:30 - 00:29:52:08
Will.

00:29:52:08 - 00:29:52:15
It's

00:29:52:15 - 00:29:52:24
been

00:29:52:24 - 00:29:53:06
a long time

00:29:53:06 - 00:29:53:22
coming

00:29:53:22 - 00:29:53:29
for

00:29:53:29 - 00:29:53:43
both

00:29:53:43 - 00:29:54:01
of these

00:29:54:01 - 00:29:54:43
teams.

00:29:54:43 - 00:29:55:04
What are they?

00:29:55:04 - 00:29:55:31
IMF

00:29:55:31 - 00:29:56:29
passive

00:29:56:33 - 00:29:57:00
should be

00:29:57:00 - 00:29:57:07
what

00:29:57:07 - 00:29:57:19
I think

00:29:57:19 - 00:29:57:39
I am.

00:29:57:39 - 00:29:57:52
I think

00:29:57:52 - 00:29:58:13
passive

00:29:58:13 - 00:29:58:24
should

00:29:58:24 - 00:29:58:37
be

00:29:58:37 - 00:29:59:16
presented

00:29:59:16 - 00:29:59:22
by.

00:30:00:50 - 00:30:01:21
I

00:30:01:21 - 00:30:01:31
think

00:30:01:31 - 00:30:01:57
passive.

00:30:01:57 - 00:30:02:06
What

00:30:02:06 - 00:30:02:15
should

00:30:02:15 - 00:30:02:58
it be?

Seven

00:30:05:02 - 00:30:05:16
that.

00:30:05:24 - 00:30:05:33
I

00:30:05:33 - 00:30:05:40
don't

00:30:05:40 - 00:30:05:47

00:30:05:47 - 00:30:06:05

00:30:06:05 - 00:30:06:19
Give

00:30:06:19 - 00:30:06:32

Level

00:30:18:10 - 00:30:18:34
exactly

00:30:18:34 - 00:30:18:41
what

00:30:18:41 - 00:30:18:54
Bong

00:30:18:54 - 00:30:18:59
is

00:30:18:59 - 00:30:19:13
looking

00:30:19:13 - 00:30:19:22
for

00:30:19:22 - 00:30:19:35
even

00:30:19:35 - 00:30:19:42
this

00:30:19:42 - 00:30:20:11
positioning

00:30:20:11 - 00:30:20:22
here

00:30:20:22 - 00:30:20:40
you can see

00:30:20:40 - 00:30:20:58
him

00:30:21:03 - 00:30:21:34
5%

00:30:21:34 - 00:30:21:52
crit.

00:30:21:52 - 00:30:22:06
Yeah

00:30:22:06 - 00:30:22:15
that'd

00:30:22:15 - 00:30:22:21
be

00:30:22:21 - 00:30:22:35
fine.

00:30:22:35 - 00:30:24:00
258

00:30:24:00 - 00:30:24:36
and 5%

00:30:24:36 - 00:30:24:50
crit

00:30:24:50 - 00:30:25:46
would be amazing.

00:30:25:46 - 00:30:26:15
I might be

00:30:26:15 - 00:30:26:31
caught

00:30:26:31 - 00:30:26:45
here.

00:30:26:45 - 00:30:27:07
Is that

00:30:27:07 - 00:30:27:19
in that

00:30:27:19 - 00:30:27:43
grill,

00:30:27:43 - 00:30:27:57
dude?

00:30:27:57 - 00:30:28:22
Of course

00:30:28:22 - 00:30:28:46
it is.

00:30:28:46 - 00:30:29:27
It's

00:30:29:27 - 00:30:29:49
Bong

00:30:29:49 - 00:30:30:23
Lesnar,

00:30:30:23 - 00:30:31:24
guys.

00:30:31:35 - 00:30:31:49
Okay,

00:30:31:49 - 00:30:31:58
so

00:30:31:58 - 00:30:32:18
they are

00:30:32:18 - 00:30:32:33
going

00:30:32:33 - 00:30:32:43
full

00:30:32:43 - 00:30:33:23

00:30:33:36 - 00:30:33:50
Lane

00:30:33:50 - 00:30:34:13
room

00:30:34:13 - 00:30:35:22
runs.

00:30:35:22 - 00:30:35:31
So

00:30:35:31 - 00:30:35:36
it's

00:30:35:36 - 00:30:35:43
going

00:30:35:43 - 00:30:35:51
to be

00:30:35:51 - 00:30:36:03
he'll

00:30:36:03 - 00:30:36:19
ignite

00:30:36:19 - 00:30:36:36

00:30:36:36 - 00:30:36:45
he'll

00:30:36:45 - 00:30:37:24
ignite it

00:30:37:31 - 00:30:38:00
Let me get up

00:30:38:00 - 00:30:38:09

00:30:38:09 - 00:30:38:45
open

look

00:30:39:14 - 00:30:39:18
of

00:30:39:18 - 00:30:39:30

00:30:39:30 - 00:30:39:36

Okay,

00:31:17:16 - 00:31:17:31

00:31:17:31 - 00:31:17:45

You're

But

00:31:24:12 - 00:31:24:46

00:32:21:43 - 00:32:21:54
started

00:32:21:54 - 00:32:21:57
to

00:32:21:57 - 00:32:22:06
come

00:32:22:06 - 00:32:22:19
through

00:32:22:19 - 00:32:22:28
there.

00:32:22:28 - 00:32:23:00
So

00:32:23:33 - 00:32:23:57
that

00:32:24:03 - 00:32:24:21
shelf

00:32:24:21 - 00:32:24:34
and me

00:32:24:34 - 00:32:24:45
thank you

00:32:24:45 - 00:32:24:48
for

00:32:24:48 - 00:32:25:24
subbing

00:32:25:40 - 00:32:25:51
and

00:32:25:51 - 00:32:26:06
could be

00:32:26:06 - 00:32:26:13
in

00:32:26:13 - 00:32:26:52
big trouble

00:32:26:52 - 00:32:27:14
when

00:32:28:15 - 00:32:29:00
he hit

00:32:29:00 - 00:32:29:09
He's

00:32:29:09 - 00:32:29:15
not

00:32:29:15 - 00:32:29:22
going

00:32:29:22 - 00:32:29:33
to go

00:32:29:33 - 00:32:29:45
for

00:32:29:45 - 00:32:30:10
though

00:32:30:10 - 00:32:30:19
not

00:32:30:19 - 00:32:31:10
lions

00:32:31:10 - 00:32:31:24
no

00:32:31:24 - 00:32:32:15
not good enough

00:32:32:15 - 00:32:32:22
but

00:32:32:22 - 00:32:32:33
look

00:32:32:33 - 00:32:32:45
how

00:32:32:45 - 00:32:33:18
low

00:32:33:18 - 00:32:33:27
the

00:32:33:27 - 00:32:33:37
all

00:32:33:37 - 00:32:33:54
seven

00:32:33:54 - 00:32:34:08
health

00:32:34:08 - 00:32:34:24
bars

00:32:34:24 - 00:32:34:53
are.

00:32:34:58 - 00:32:35:24
They can't

00:32:35:24 - 00:32:35:36
walk

00:32:35:36 - 00:32:35:51
back

00:32:35:51 - 00:32:35:58
the

00:32:35:58 - 00:32:36:34
line.

00:32:36:34 - 00:32:36:46
Yeah.

00:32:36:46 - 00:32:37:06
Without

00:32:37:06 - 00:32:37:19
a lot

00:32:37:19 - 00:32:37:28
of

00:32:37:28 - 00:32:37:53
carving.

00:32:37:53 - 00:32:38:38
Oh,

00:32:38:38 - 00:32:38:51
my

00:32:38:51 - 00:32:39:02
God.

00:32:39:02 - 00:32:39:27
Thoughts?

00:32:39:27 - 00:32:39:41
Right

00:32:39:41 - 00:32:39:55
out of

00:32:39:55 - 00:32:40:06
this

00:32:40:06 - 00:32:40:55
changing the way.

00:32:40:55 - 00:32:41:29
So now

00:32:41:29 - 00:32:41:38
let's

00:32:41:38 - 00:32:41:56
get to

00:32:41:56 - 00:32:42:42
the third

00:32:42:42 - 00:32:43:09
thing

00:32:44:11 - 00:32:45:09
to do.

00:32:45:09 - 00:32:45:27
Yeah,

00:32:45:27 - 00:32:46:06
go

00:32:46:19 - 00:32:46:31
through

00:32:46:31 - 00:32:47:02
not.

00:32:47:02 - 00:32:47:18
But

00:32:47:18 - 00:32:47:38
you know

00:32:47:38 - 00:32:47:58
this,

00:32:47:58 - 00:32:48:09
you

00:32:48:09 - 00:32:48:19
know,

00:32:48:19 - 00:32:48:27
the

00:32:48:27 - 00:32:48:45
skin

00:32:48:45 - 00:32:48:54
has

00:32:48:54 - 00:32:49:04
been

00:32:49:04 - 00:32:49:54
disabled

00:32:49:54 - 00:32:50:13
for

00:32:50:15 - 00:32:50:20
the

00:32:50:20 - 00:32:50:34
long

00:32:50:34 - 00:32:51:00
term.

00:32:51:00 - 00:32:51:19
Really

00:32:51:19 - 00:32:51:58
reason

00:32:52:01 - 00:32:52:17
why

00:32:52:17 - 00:32:52:46
all

00:32:53:06 - 00:32:53:38
this

00:32:53:47 - 00:32:54:00
though

00:32:54:00 - 00:32:54:18
It's

00:32:54:18 - 00:32:54:34
like

00:32:54:34 - 00:32:54:46
this

00:32:54:46 - 00:32:54:57
game

00:32:54:57 - 00:32:55:06
was

00:32:55:06 - 00:32:55:22
really

00:32:55:22 - 00:32:55:57
visual.

00:32:55:57 - 00:32:56:22
Visually,

00:32:56:22 - 00:32:57:12
it was disgusting.

00:32:57:12 - 00:32:57:23
But

00:32:57:23 - 00:32:57:46
they

00:32:57:46 - 00:32:58:12
okay,

00:32:58:12 - 00:32:58:22
they

00:32:58:22 - 00:32:58:40
put it

00:32:58:40 - 00:32:58:58
back.

00:32:58:58 - 00:32:59:24
I don't know.

00:32:59:24 - 00:32:59:56
I guess

00:32:59:56 - 00:33:00:03
they

00:33:00:03 - 00:33:00:21
fix

00:33:00:21 - 00:33:00:51
it.

00:33:00:51 - 00:33:01:17
All right.

00:33:01:17 - 00:33:02:04
All right.

00:33:02:04 - 00:33:02:15
That's

00:33:02:15 - 00:33:02:42
crazy

00:33:02:42 - 00:33:02:54
stuff.

00:33:02:54 - 00:33:03:37
We were

00:33:03:39 - 00:33:03:54
just

00:33:03:54 - 00:33:04:15
a bit

00:33:04:15 - 00:33:04:34
I mean,

00:33:04:34 - 00:33:04:48
just

00:33:04:48 - 00:33:05:18
to be

00:33:05:18 - 00:33:05:30
there,

00:33:05:30 - 00:33:05:40
but

00:33:05:40 - 00:33:05:49
for

00:33:05:49 - 00:33:06:18
like

00:33:06:18 - 00:33:06:41
five

00:33:06:41 - 00:33:06:47
or

00:33:06:47 - 00:33:07:13
six,

00:33:07:13 - 00:33:07:28
maybe

00:33:07:28 - 00:33:07:42
more,

00:33:07:42 - 00:33:07:55
I don't

00:33:07:55 - 00:33:08:06
know.

00:33:08:06 - 00:33:08:36
Another

00:33:08:36 - 00:33:08:58
just

00:33:08:58 - 00:33:10:12
so but

00:33:10:12 - 00:33:10:44
the

00:33:11:02 - 00:33:11:43
recently

00:33:11:43 - 00:33:12:28
discovered

00:33:12:28 - 00:33:13:04
when people

00:33:13:04 - 00:33:13:22
started

00:33:13:22 - 00:33:13:37
playing

00:33:13:51 - 00:33:14:04
those

00:33:14:04 - 00:33:14:28
that

00:33:14:31 - 00:33:14:42
they

00:33:14:42 - 00:33:14:54
just

00:33:14:54 - 00:33:15:09
play

00:33:15:09 - 00:33:15:37
along

00:33:15:37 - 00:33:16:14
the skins

00:33:16:14 - 00:33:16:28
like

00:33:16:28 - 00:33:16:37
got

00:33:16:37 - 00:33:17:07
the

00:33:17:07 - 00:33:17:22
put

00:33:17:22 - 00:33:17:27
it

00:33:17:27 - 00:33:17:43
back

00:33:17:43 - 00:33:17:47
in

00:33:17:47 - 00:33:18:23
the game

00:33:18:27 - 00:33:19:06
right

00:33:19:22 - 00:33:19:31
now

00:33:19:31 - 00:33:20:00
you can

00:33:20:04 - 00:33:20:29
but

00:33:20:36 - 00:33:20:56
I mean

00:33:20:56 - 00:33:21:12
I don't

00:33:21:12 - 00:33:21:37
know

00:33:21:54 - 00:33:22:34
even

00:33:23:07 - 00:33:23:36
just

00:33:23:58 - 00:33:25:55

00:33:32:27 - 00:33:32:49
sure.

00:33:32:58 - 00:33:33:14
It was

00:33:33:14 - 00:33:33:39
terrible

00:33:33:39 - 00:33:33:49
and

00:33:34:51 - 00:33:35:22
Jesus

00:33:35:22 - 00:33:36:34
Christ

00:33:36:34 - 00:33:36:57
I

00:33:36:57 - 00:33:37:02
don't

00:33:37:04 - 00:33:37:13

00:33:38:09 - 00:33:38:36
My

00:33:38:36 - 00:33:39:59
God,

to get

00:33:41:29 - 00:33:41:36
a lot

00:33:41:36 - 00:33:41:40
of

00:33:41:40 - 00:33:42:05
pressure.

00:33:42:05 - 00:33:42:18
Yeah.

00:33:42:18 - 00:33:43:24
Oh,

00:33:46:12 - 00:33:46:39
I mean,

00:33:46:39 - 00:33:46:48
I've

informed

00:33:53:00 - 00:33:53:13
me and

00:33:53:13 - 00:33:53:31
you know

00:33:53:31 - 00:33:53:40

has

00:33:54:14 - 00:33:54:57
90%

00:33:54:57 - 00:33:55:26
AP on

cue

00:33:55:37 - 00:33:55:44
and

better

00:33:57:36 - 00:33:57:42
and

00:33:57:42 - 00:33:57:47
the

00:33:58:44 - 00:33:59:16
ratio

00:33:59:16 - 00:33:59:45
the east

00:33:59:45 - 00:34:00:09
curling

00:34:00:09 - 00:34:00:21

00:34:02:36 - 00:34:02:58
scaling

00:34:02:58 - 00:34:04:56
is 55%

00:34:04:56 - 00:34:05:28
isn't

00:34:05:43 - 00:34:05:52
it

00:34:05:52 - 00:34:06:09
isn't

00:34:06:09 - 00:34:06:45
mountainous

00:34:06:45 - 00:34:07:21
passive

00:34:07:21 - 00:34:07:44
also

00:34:07:44 - 00:34:07:57
not

00:34:07:57 - 00:34:08:27
that

00:34:08:27 - 00:34:08:41
what

00:34:08:41 - 00:34:09:02
I'm

00:34:09:32 - 00:34:09:57
upset

00:34:09:57 - 00:34:10:03
and

00:34:10:03 - 00:34:10:10
it's

00:34:10:10 - 00:34:10:22

now

00:34:10:48 - 00:34:11:22

we're

00:34:11:56 - 00:34:12:54
keeping up

00:34:12:54 - 00:34:13:13
think

00:34:13:13 - 00:34:13:30
it was

00:34:13:30 - 00:34:13:42

00:34:16:21 - 00:34:16:39
it's

00:34:16:39 - 00:34:16:56

it's

00:34:28:22 - 00:34:28:35
good

00:34:28:35 - 00:34:29:04
Skillings

00:34:29:04 - 00:34:29:25
I mean

00:34:29:25 - 00:34:29:51
I could

00:34:29:51 - 00:34:30:16
imagine

00:34:30:16 - 00:34:31:19
going

00:34:31:19 - 00:34:31:51
ROA

00:34:31:51 - 00:34:32:24
That's

00:34:32:47 - 00:34:33:18
right

00:34:33:18 - 00:34:34:04
Yeah.

00:34:34:07 - 00:34:34:42
Yeah.

00:34:35:12 - 00:34:35:22
Of

00:34:35:49 - 00:34:37:12
ROA.

00:34:37:24 - 00:34:38:04
Yeah.

00:34:38:13 - 00:34:38:25
But

00:34:38:25 - 00:34:38:51
this game

00:34:38:51 - 00:34:39:00
I'm

00:34:39:00 - 00:34:39:10
not

00:34:39:10 - 00:34:39:19
sure

00:34:39:19 - 00:34:39:34
if you

00:34:39:34 - 00:34:39:49
need

00:34:39:49 - 00:34:40:13
to

00:34:40:26 - 00:34:40:37
feel

00:34:40:37 - 00:34:40:46
like

00:34:40:46 - 00:34:41:02
I can

00:34:41:02 - 00:34:41:15
just

00:34:41:15 - 00:34:41:29
go.

00:34:41:29 - 00:34:41:54
Was

00:34:41:54 - 00:34:42:30
even

00:34:42:30 - 00:34:42:48
ever

00:34:42:48 - 00:34:43:27
so

00:34:43:31 - 00:34:43:44
much.

00:34:43:44 - 00:34:44:27
I think

00:34:44:36 - 00:34:44:54
Evan

00:34:44:54 - 00:34:45:09
Trout

00:34:45:09 - 00:34:45:21
would be

00:34:45:21 - 00:34:46:01
fine

00:34:46:01 - 00:34:46:08
for

00:34:46:08 - 00:34:46:28
coming on

00:34:46:28 - 00:34:46:40
line

00:34:46:40 - 00:34:46:52
so

00:34:46:52 - 00:34:47:43
I don't know.

00:34:47:43 - 00:34:47:58
I don't

00:34:47:58 - 00:34:48:14
know.

00:34:48:14 - 00:34:48:37
Yeah,

00:34:48:37 - 00:34:48:48
because

00:34:48:48 - 00:34:48:54
I

00:34:48:54 - 00:34:49:03
don't

00:34:49:03 - 00:34:49:08
know

00:34:49:08 - 00:34:49:21
if you

00:34:49:21 - 00:34:49:33
can

00:34:49:33 - 00:34:49:48
Come

00:34:49:48 - 00:34:50:15
on.

00:34:50:22 - 00:34:50:49
This game

00:34:50:49 - 00:34:51:01
should

00:34:51:01 - 00:34:51:50
kinda

00:34:51:50 - 00:34:52:22
read

00:34:52:28 - 00:34:52:37
the

00:34:52:37 - 00:34:52:48
way

00:34:52:48 - 00:34:52:55
the

00:34:52:55 - 00:34:53:20
bottleneck.

00:34:53:20 - 00:34:53:34
Look,

00:34:53:34 - 00:34:53:54
I mean,

00:34:53:54 - 00:34:54:00
the

00:34:54:00 - 00:34:54:21
bottleneck

00:34:54:21 - 00:34:54:39
kind

00:34:54:39 - 00:34:54:50
of

00:34:54:59 - 00:34:56:07
came back

00:34:56:18 - 00:34:56:29
or

00:34:56:29 - 00:34:56:42
that

00:34:56:42 - 00:34:57:06
they.

00:34:57:46 - 00:34:58:01
They have

00:34:58:01 - 00:34:58:10
to

00:34:58:10 - 00:34:58:28
base

00:34:58:28 - 00:34:58:44
now.

00:34:58:44 - 00:34:58:56
Not

00:34:58:56 - 00:34:59:06
you

00:34:59:06 - 00:34:59:20
have to

00:34:59:20 - 00:34:59:38
be.

00:34:59:40 - 00:35:00:08
Yeah.

00:35:00:21 - 00:35:00:26
They're

00:35:00:26 - 00:35:00:34
going

00:35:00:34 - 00:35:00:37
to

00:35:00:37 - 00:35:00:46
miss

00:35:00:46 - 00:35:01:01
away.

00:35:01:01 - 00:35:01:15
Yeah.

00:35:01:15 - 00:35:01:30
But

00:35:01:30 - 00:35:01:40
then

00:35:01:40 - 00:35:02:00
they'll be

00:35:02:00 - 00:35:02:09
the

00:35:02:09 - 00:35:02:41
more

00:35:02:41 - 00:35:02:51
the

00:35:02:51 - 00:35:02:59
right

00:35:03:12 - 00:35:03:26
and

00:35:03:26 - 00:35:03:45
also

00:35:03:45 - 00:35:03:52
the

00:35:03:52 - 00:35:04:04
just

00:35:04:04 - 00:35:04:21
losing

00:35:04:21 - 00:35:04:38
played

00:35:04:38 - 00:35:05:51
a lot of

00:35:05:51 - 00:35:06:03
other

00:35:06:03 - 00:35:06:23
kinda

00:35:06:23 - 00:35:06:46
came back

00:35:06:46 - 00:35:07:01
but I

00:35:07:01 - 00:35:07:13
guess

00:35:07:13 - 00:35:07:21
they're

00:35:07:21 - 00:35:07:32
just

00:35:07:32 - 00:35:07:39
too

00:35:07:39 - 00:35:07:56
freely

00:35:07:56 - 00:35:08:16
but

00:35:08:16 - 00:35:08:45
it's

00:35:08:49 - 00:35:09:18
Yeah

00:35:09:25 - 00:35:10:03
20

00:35:10:03 - 00:35:10:49
3060

00:35:10:49 - 00:35:11:00
now

00:35:11:00 - 00:35:11:15
opening

00:35:11:15 - 00:35:11:27
up the

00:35:11:27 - 00:35:11:40
block

00:35:11:40 - 00:35:11:51
like

00:35:13:46 - 00:35:13:51

00:35:13:51 - 00:35:13:58
don't

00:35:13:58 - 00:35:14:40

hope

00:35:16:15 - 00:35:16:37
to do

00:35:16:37 - 00:35:16:53
really

00:35:16:53 - 00:35:17:09

00:35:17:09 - 00:35:17:38
game

00:35:17:41 - 00:35:17:49

00:36:01:39 - 00:36:02:13
bunk

00:36:02:13 - 00:36:02:28
but

00:36:02:28 - 00:36:02:47
yeah

00:36:02:47 - 00:36:03:02
that's

00:36:03:02 - 00:36:03:26
yeah

00:36:03:26 - 00:36:03:59
yeah

00:36:04:10 - 00:36:04:37
it's

00:36:04:46 - 00:36:05:00
it's

00:36:05:00 - 00:36:05:15
not

00:36:05:15 - 00:36:05:25
it's

00:36:05:25 - 00:36:05:45
probably

00:36:05:45 - 00:36:06:06
not

00:36:06:06 - 00:36:07:04
okay

00:36:07:48 - 00:36:08:18
though

00:36:08:51 - 00:36:09:00
but

00:36:09:00 - 00:36:10:22
if some adults

00:36:10:22 - 00:36:10:37
really

00:36:10:37 - 00:36:10:49
want a

00:36:10:49 - 00:36:11:00
good

00:36:11:00 - 00:36:11:20
joke

00:36:11:20 - 00:36:11:45
myself.

00:36:11:45 - 00:36:11:51
Yeah,

00:36:11:51 - 00:36:12:01
but

00:36:12:01 - 00:36:12:25
nobody

00:36:12:25 - 00:36:12:46
really

00:36:12:46 - 00:36:13:10
thought

00:36:13:10 - 00:36:13:19
about

00:36:13:25 - 00:36:13:30
it.

00:36:13:30 - 00:36:14:06
Well,

00:36:14:06 - 00:36:14:27
what

00:36:14:27 - 00:36:14:52
do you make

00:36:14:52 - 00:36:15:21
of.

00:36:15:21 - 00:36:15:48
I don't

00:36:15:48 - 00:36:16:17
remember.

00:36:16:17 - 00:36:16:56
I was

00:36:16:56 - 00:36:17:16
it was

00:36:17:16 - 00:36:17:38
actually

00:36:17:38 - 00:36:18:07
very,

00:36:18:07 - 00:36:18:25
very

00:36:18:25 - 00:36:18:53
clever

00:36:18:53 - 00:36:19:01
and

00:36:19:01 - 00:36:19:21
nice

00:36:19:21 - 00:36:19:42
and,

00:36:20:07 - 00:36:20:20
and

00:36:20:20 - 00:36:20:36
we are

00:36:20:36 - 00:36:20:51
like

00:36:20:51 - 00:36:21:07
it was

00:36:21:07 - 00:36:21:12
in

00:36:21:12 - 00:36:21:34
the middle

00:36:21:34 - 00:36:21:45
of the

00:36:21:45 - 00:36:22:22
fire.

00:36:22:22 - 00:36:22:37
Yeah.

00:36:22:37 - 00:36:22:56
Nobody

00:36:22:56 - 00:36:23:22
cared.

00:36:23:22 - 00:36:23:36
And I

00:36:23:36 - 00:36:23:45
was

00:36:23:45 - 00:36:24:03
like,

00:36:24:03 - 00:36:24:28
holy.

00:36:24:28 - 00:36:24:39
That was

00:36:24:39 - 00:36:24:45
the

00:36:24:45 - 00:36:25:04
most

00:36:25:04 - 00:36:25:24
of the

00:36:25:24 - 00:36:25:37
whole

00:36:25:37 - 00:36:26:08
thing.

00:36:26:16 - 00:36:26:25
You,

00:36:27:03 - 00:36:27:09
you've

00:36:27:09 - 00:36:27:25
probably

00:36:27:25 - 00:36:27:37
felt

00:36:27:37 - 00:36:27:50
so

00:36:27:50 - 00:36:28:22
bad.

00:36:28:39 - 00:36:29:04
Yeah.

00:36:29:04 - 00:36:29:18
Like

00:36:29:18 - 00:36:29:51
good.

00:36:30:37 - 00:36:30:53
The

00:36:31:24 - 00:36:31:42
group.

00:36:31:42 - 00:36:32:13
Good

00:36:32:46 - 00:36:33:07
luck.

00:36:33:07 - 00:36:33:16
Look

00:36:33:16 - 00:36:33:36
at the

00:36:33:36 - 00:36:33:57
ticket

00:36:33:57 - 00:36:34:51
later.

00:36:35:06 - 00:36:35:25
Put out

00:36:35:25 - 00:36:35:38
this

00:36:35:38 - 00:36:35:52
game

00:36:35:52 - 00:36:36:01
for

00:36:36:01 - 00:36:36:34
sure.

00:36:36:34 - 00:36:36:52
Not

00:36:36:52 - 00:36:37:24
easy.

00:36:37:24 - 00:36:37:40
Not

00:36:37:40 - 00:36:38:20
easy.

00:36:38:20 - 00:36:38:27
And a

00:36:38:27 - 00:36:38:36
bit

00:36:38:36 - 00:36:39:30
nervous,

00:36:39:30 - 00:36:39:39
do

00:36:39:39 - 00:36:39:46
we

00:36:39:46 - 00:36:40:15
are.

00:36:40:53 - 00:36:41:07
But

00:36:41:07 - 00:36:41:36
we are

00:36:41:36 - 00:36:41:56
doing

00:36:41:56 - 00:36:42:07
this

00:36:42:07 - 00:36:42:12
at

00:36:42:12 - 00:36:42:26
level

00:36:42:26 - 00:36:42:52
five.

00:36:42:52 - 00:36:43:06
We're

00:36:43:06 - 00:36:43:33
chilling.

00:36:43:33 - 00:36:43:42
We're

00:36:43:42 - 00:36:44:07
fighting

00:36:44:07 - 00:36:44:17
for

00:36:44:17 - 00:36:45:26
the Drake.

00:36:45:26 - 00:36:45:52
They haven't

00:36:45:52 - 00:36:46:13
died

00:36:46:13 - 00:36:46:24
yet,

00:36:46:24 - 00:36:46:51
though,

00:36:46:51 - 00:36:47:06
which

00:36:47:06 - 00:36:47:34
is

00:36:48:07 - 00:36:48:31
not.

00:36:48:43 - 00:36:49:04
Yeah.

00:36:49:04 - 00:36:49:35
Yeah.

00:36:49:35 - 00:36:50:54
I like

00:36:50:54 - 00:36:51:16
legit

00:36:51:16 - 00:36:51:37
the game

00:36:51:37 - 00:36:51:54
itself

00:36:51:54 - 00:36:52:06
like

00:36:52:06 - 00:36:52:26
over.

00:36:52:26 - 00:36:52:37
But

00:36:52:37 - 00:36:53:00
obviously

00:36:53:00 - 00:36:53:15
from

00:36:53:15 - 00:36:53:34
bottom

00:36:53:34 - 00:36:54:03
perspective

00:36:54:03 - 00:36:54:21
they look

00:36:54:21 - 00:36:54:36
very

00:36:54:36 - 00:36:54:50
hard.

00:36:54:50 - 00:36:55:04
But

00:36:55:04 - 00:36:55:33
yeah

00:36:55:33 - 00:36:55:46
that's

00:36:55:46 - 00:36:55:51
for

00:36:55:51 - 00:36:56:20
sure.

00:36:57:00 - 00:36:57:10
Like

00:36:57:10 - 00:36:57:25
but

00:36:57:25 - 00:36:57:41
there's

00:36:57:41 - 00:36:58:34
like a

00:36:58:40 - 00:36:59:07
Yeah,

00:36:59:07 - 00:36:59:20
that's

00:36:59:20 - 00:36:59:27
a,

00:36:59:42 - 00:37:00:00
there's

00:37:00:00 - 00:37:00:03
a

00:37:00:03 - 00:37:00:10
little

00:37:00:10 - 00:37:00:19
bit

00:37:00:19 - 00:37:00:46
of chaos

00:37:00:46 - 00:37:01:01
there

00:37:01:01 - 00:37:01:10
and

00:37:01:10 - 00:37:01:49
losses

00:37:01:49 - 00:37:02:15
like

00:37:02:34 - 00:37:03:16
11 and

00:37:03:16 - 00:37:03:34
a half

00:37:03:34 - 00:37:03:57
maybe

00:37:03:57 - 00:37:04:08
full

00:37:04:08 - 00:37:04:54
level.

00:37:04:54 - 00:37:05:15
I mean

00:37:05:15 - 00:37:05:25
for

00:37:05:25 - 00:37:05:37
sure.

00:37:05:37 - 00:37:06:04
Yeah.

00:37:06:15 - 00:37:06:39
Level

00:37:06:39 - 00:37:06:46
up

00:37:06:46 - 00:37:07:12
though.

00:37:07:28 - 00:37:07:46

00:37:13:44 - 00:37:14:04
the end

00:37:14:04 - 00:37:14:18

right

00:37:19:15 - 00:37:19:28
but

00:37:19:28 - 00:37:19:42
not

00:37:19:42 - 00:37:19:57
good

00:37:20:54 - 00:37:21:09
to put

00:37:21:09 - 00:37:21:27
pressure

00:37:21:27 - 00:37:21:59
elsewhere.

00:37:22:03 - 00:37:22:13
And

listeners

00:37:23:11 - 00:37:24:05
kinda

00:37:24:05 - 00:37:24:34

sure

00:37:24:54 - 00:37:25:22
that

00:37:25:22 - 00:37:25:40
vocal

00:37:28:44 - 00:37:29:38
someone

00:37:29:40 - 00:37:29:54
that

00:37:29:54 - 00:37:30:34
would

00:37:30:34 - 00:37:30:52
be

00:37:30:52 - 00:37:31:19
just

00:37:31:19 - 00:37:31:33
out of

00:37:31:33 - 00:37:31:53
range

00:37:31:53 - 00:37:31:57
of

00:37:31:57 - 00:37:33:10
the control

that is

00:37:33:36 - 00:37:33:50
so

crazy

00:37:34:12 - 00:37:34:24
by the

00:37:34:24 - 00:37:34:35
way.

00:37:34:35 - 00:37:34:58
Yeah,

00:37:34:58 - 00:37:35:13
but

00:37:35:13 - 00:37:35:42
that word

00:37:35:42 - 00:37:35:47
at

00:37:35:47 - 00:37:36:12
comp

00:37:36:12 - 00:37:36:30

00:37:36:48 - 00:37:36:57
of the

00:37:36:57 - 00:37:37:15
control

00:37:37:15 - 00:37:37:44
word

00:37:38:02 - 00:37:38:18
order.

00:37:38:18 - 00:37:38:34
You

00:37:38:34 - 00:37:38:51
did

00:37:38:51 - 00:37:39:01
get

00:37:39:01 - 00:37:39:09
his

00:37:39:09 - 00:37:39:30
wolves.

00:37:39:30 - 00:37:39:52
Yeah,

00:37:39:52 - 00:37:40:19
but

00:37:40:19 - 00:37:40:58
this control

00:37:40:58 - 00:37:41:06
is

00:37:41:06 - 00:37:41:18
very

00:37:41:18 - 00:37:41:33
bad.

00:37:41:33 - 00:37:42:07
The Pope,

00:37:42:07 - 00:37:42:18
by

00:37:42:18 - 00:37:42:36
the way.

00:37:42:36 - 00:37:42:54
It's

00:37:42:54 - 00:37:43:06
very

00:37:43:06 - 00:37:43:26
bloody.

00:37:43:26 - 00:37:43:46
Put

00:37:43:46 - 00:37:44:43
that control.

00:37:44:43 - 00:37:44:58
Yeah

00:37:44:58 - 00:37:45:12
it's

00:37:45:12 - 00:37:45:55
not.

00:37:46:55 - 00:37:47:22
Yeah.

00:37:47:22 - 00:37:47:54
Look

00:37:48:10 - 00:37:48:32
if out

00:37:48:32 - 00:37:48:43
there

00:37:48:43 - 00:37:49:04
control

00:37:49:04 - 00:37:49:12
are

00:37:49:12 - 00:37:49:24
being

00:37:49:24 - 00:37:49:39
put

00:37:49:39 - 00:37:49:49
like

00:37:49:49 - 00:37:50:07
this

00:37:50:07 - 00:37:50:18
it's.

00:37:50:18 - 00:37:51:41
Oh my.

00:37:51:45 - 00:37:52:39
Oh

00:37:52:40 - 00:37:54:07
there's an

00:37:54:07 - 00:37:54:45
okay

00:37:54:45 - 00:37:54:57
so

00:37:54:57 - 00:37:55:21
riot

00:37:55:21 - 00:37:55:35
was

00:37:55:35 - 00:37:55:43
the

00:37:55:43 - 00:37:56:01
10th

00:37:56:01 - 00:37:56:24
delay

00:37:56:24 - 00:37:56:38
so

00:37:56:38 - 00:37:57:01
we cannot

00:37:57:01 - 00:37:57:09
do

00:37:57:09 - 00:37:58:03
this.

00:37:58:03 - 00:37:58:57
Okay.

00:37:58:57 - 00:37:59:26
Nice,

00:37:59:26 - 00:38:00:06
nice.

00:38:00:09 - 00:38:00:45
Well

00:38:00:45 - 00:38:01:12
this was

00:38:01:12 - 00:38:01:17
the

00:38:01:17 - 00:38:01:37
wave

00:38:01:37 - 00:38:01:55
or

00:38:01:55 - 00:38:02:18
seventh

00:38:02:18 - 00:38:02:34
but

00:38:02:34 - 00:38:03:05
actually,

00:38:03:05 - 00:38:03:21
yeah,

00:38:03:21 - 00:38:03:34
that

00:38:03:34 - 00:38:03:52
turns

00:38:03:52 - 00:38:03:58
on

00:38:03:58 - 00:38:04:28
the waves

00:38:04:28 - 00:38:05:00
when I saw

00:38:05:00 - 00:38:05:10
it.

00:38:05:10 - 00:38:05:25
That's

00:38:05:25 - 00:38:05:42
so

00:38:05:42 - 00:38:06:48
disgusting.

00:38:06:48 - 00:38:07:46
Why did that?

00:38:07:46 - 00:38:08:09
Yeah,

00:38:08:09 - 00:38:08:27
I did.

00:38:08:27 - 00:38:08:51
I did

00:38:08:51 - 00:38:09:10
a review.

00:38:09:10 - 00:38:09:52
Why do you think

00:38:09:52 - 00:38:10:03
it's

00:38:10:03 - 00:38:10:55
disgusting?

00:38:10:55 - 00:38:11:07
I

00:38:11:07 - 00:38:11:29
just.

00:38:11:29 - 00:38:11:38
I

00:38:11:38 - 00:38:12:07
just think

00:38:12:07 - 00:38:12:30
it makes

00:38:12:30 - 00:38:12:54
the game

00:38:12:54 - 00:38:14:51
so

00:38:14:51 - 00:38:15:21
dependent

00:38:15:21 - 00:38:15:34
on the

00:38:15:34 - 00:38:16:03
jungler.

00:38:16:03 - 00:38:16:29
No,

00:38:16:39 - 00:38:16:51
it's

00:38:16:57 - 00:38:17:13
like

00:38:17:33 - 00:38:17:51
an

00:38:17:51 - 00:38:18:19
jungler.

00:38:18:19 - 00:38:18:41
Cannot

00:38:18:41 - 00:38:19:31
really.

00:38:19:35 - 00:38:19:55
There's

00:38:19:55 - 00:38:20:38
no

00:38:20:38 - 00:38:21:09
a point

00:38:21:09 - 00:38:21:18
where

00:38:21:18 - 00:38:21:23
you

00:38:21:23 - 00:38:21:36
can

00:38:21:36 - 00:38:21:52
play

00:38:21:52 - 00:38:22:24
from

00:38:22:24 - 00:38:22:39
like.

00:38:22:39 - 00:38:22:57
Right.

00:38:22:57 - 00:38:23:04
And

00:38:23:04 - 00:38:23:31
normally

00:38:23:31 - 00:38:23:49
now

00:38:23:49 - 00:38:24:12
obviously

00:38:24:12 - 00:38:24:18
you

00:38:24:18 - 00:38:24:28
can

00:38:24:28 - 00:38:24:39
play

00:38:24:39 - 00:38:25:08
from

00:38:25:08 - 00:38:25:21
right

00:38:25:21 - 00:38:25:31
then

00:38:25:31 - 00:38:25:39
it's

00:38:25:39 - 00:38:25:46
like

00:38:25:46 - 00:38:25:55
they,

00:38:25:55 - 00:38:26:00
you

00:38:26:00 - 00:38:26:16
just

00:38:26:16 - 00:38:26:27
but

00:38:26:27 - 00:38:26:49
they can

00:38:26:49 - 00:38:27:01
move

00:38:27:01 - 00:38:27:14
into

00:38:27:14 - 00:38:27:30
slide

00:38:27:30 - 00:38:27:36
and

00:38:27:36 - 00:38:28:30
pressure

00:38:28:31 - 00:38:28:40
flow

00:38:28:40 - 00:38:28:51
can

00:38:28:51 - 00:38:29:06
actually

00:38:29:06 - 00:38:29:19
play

00:38:29:19 - 00:38:30:21
as thing.

00:38:30:21 - 00:38:30:37
Now

00:38:30:37 - 00:38:30:55
their game

00:38:30:55 - 00:38:31:13
will be

00:38:31:13 - 00:38:32:07
like a lot.

00:38:32:07 - 00:38:32:33
I mean

00:38:32:33 - 00:38:32:49
good

00:38:32:49 - 00:38:33:02
thing

00:38:33:02 - 00:38:33:18
is

00:38:33:27 - 00:38:34:10
it'll be

00:38:34:10 - 00:38:34:21
it

00:38:34:21 - 00:38:34:46
might be

00:38:34:46 - 00:38:35:04
more

00:38:35:04 - 00:38:35:42
individually

00:38:35:42 - 00:38:36:10
like

00:38:36:10 - 00:38:36:30
based

00:38:36:30 - 00:38:36:36
on

00:38:36:36 - 00:38:37:12
lines.

00:38:37:12 - 00:38:37:40
Yeah.

00:38:37:40 - 00:38:38:24
But

00:38:38:49 - 00:38:40:33
the thought you had

00:38:40:33 - 00:38:40:46
you

00:38:40:55 - 00:38:41:06
have

00:38:41:06 - 00:38:41:38
so much

00:38:41:38 - 00:38:42:12
information

00:38:42:12 - 00:38:42:18
in

00:38:42:18 - 00:38:42:50
order to do

00:38:42:50 - 00:38:43:01
that

00:38:43:01 - 00:38:43:12
So

00:38:43:12 - 00:38:43:33
jungler

00:38:43:33 - 00:38:43:46
might

00:38:43:46 - 00:38:44:21
become

00:38:44:22 - 00:38:44:38
even

00:38:44:38 - 00:38:44:54
more

00:38:44:54 - 00:38:45:12
of

00:38:45:12 - 00:38:45:59
like

00:38:46:10 - 00:38:46:35
endgame

00:38:46:35 - 00:38:47:11
dog,

00:38:47:18 - 00:38:47:31
right.

00:38:47:31 - 00:38:48:01
Galactic

00:38:48:01 - 00:38:48:36
vision.

00:38:48:36 - 00:38:48:55
No,

00:38:48:55 - 00:38:49:12
I feel

00:38:49:12 - 00:38:49:24
like

00:38:49:24 - 00:38:49:30
it's

00:38:49:30 - 00:38:49:48
such a

00:38:49:48 - 00:38:50:22
blatant

00:38:50:22 - 00:38:51:01
Right.

00:38:51:12 - 00:38:51:48
I feel like

00:38:51:48 - 00:38:52:06
a feel

00:38:52:06 - 00:38:52:15
like

00:38:52:15 - 00:38:52:40
jungler

00:38:52:40 - 00:38:53:02
now

00:38:53:02 - 00:38:54:10
legit.

00:38:54:12 - 00:38:54:41
Like

00:38:54:43 - 00:38:54:59
my

00:38:54:59 - 00:38:55:12
need

00:38:55:12 - 00:38:55:48
to let

00:38:55:48 - 00:38:56:49
it go

00:38:56:49 - 00:38:57:00
and

00:38:57:00 - 00:38:57:12
just

00:38:57:12 - 00:38:57:40
check

00:38:57:40 - 00:38:58:17
the spot

00:38:58:17 - 00:38:58:35
people

00:38:58:35 - 00:38:58:53
out

00:38:58:53 - 00:38:59:31
permanently

00:38:59:31 - 00:38:59:42
so

00:38:59:42 - 00:39:00:07
your lanes

00:39:00:07 - 00:39:00:16
can

00:39:00:16 - 00:39:00:27
play

00:39:00:27 - 00:39:00:52
aggro.

00:39:00:52 - 00:39:01:06
So

00:39:01:06 - 00:39:01:19
what's

00:39:01:19 - 00:39:01:40
the point

00:39:01:40 - 00:39:02:10
of the

00:39:02:10 - 00:39:02:19
sense

00:39:02:38 - 00:39:02:45
of.

00:39:02:56 - 00:39:03:19
But he

00:39:03:19 - 00:39:03:39
doesn't.

00:39:05:04 - 00:39:05:20
Even

00:39:05:20 - 00:39:05:51
nowadays

00:39:05:51 - 00:39:06:04
it's

00:39:06:04 - 00:39:06:25
like a

00:39:06:25 - 00:39:06:43
thing.

00:39:06:43 - 00:39:06:57
But

00:39:06:57 - 00:39:07:03
you

00:39:07:03 - 00:39:07:12
know,

00:39:07:12 - 00:39:07:24
not

00:39:07:24 - 00:39:07:35
so.

00:39:07:35 - 00:39:08:03
Yeah.

00:39:08:18 - 00:39:08:43
You cannot

00:39:08:43 - 00:39:09:01
do it

00:39:09:01 - 00:39:09:09
all

00:39:09:09 - 00:39:09:52
the time

00:39:09:57 - 00:39:10:14
right

00:39:10:14 - 00:39:10:44
then

00:39:10:44 - 00:39:11:02
other

00:39:11:02 - 00:39:11:18
team

00:39:11:18 - 00:39:11:34
does

00:39:11:34 - 00:39:11:54
the thing

00:39:11:54 - 00:39:12:05
but

00:39:12:05 - 00:39:12:34
yeah I

00:39:12:34 - 00:39:12:43
don't

00:39:12:43 - 00:39:13:01
know

00:39:13:22 - 00:39:13:39
maybe

00:39:13:39 - 00:39:13:53
I'm,

00:39:13:53 - 00:39:14:24
I'm a

00:39:14:24 - 00:39:14:34
bit

00:39:14:34 - 00:39:14:58
stupid

00:39:14:58 - 00:39:15:05
I'm

00:39:15:05 - 00:39:15:19
not

00:39:15:28 - 00:39:15:39

00:39:15:39 - 00:39:15:57
the game

00:39:15:57 - 00:39:16:26
to so

00:39:16:26 - 00:39:16:31
you

00:39:16:31 - 00:39:16:53
know.

00:39:17:07 - 00:39:17:58

you agree

00:39:18:57 - 00:39:19:12
that

00:39:19:12 - 00:39:19:40
Trilby

00:39:19:40 - 00:39:19:49
is

00:39:19:49 - 00:39:20:43
stupid.

00:39:21:18 - 00:39:22:01
Yeah

00:39:22:45 - 00:39:26:06
is my God.

00:39:26:06 - 00:39:26:22
Well,

00:39:28:13 - 00:39:28:19
of

00:39:28:19 - 00:39:28:33
have.

00:39:30:33 - 00:39:30:49
Tell

00:39:30:50 - 00:39:30:57
me,

was the joke

00:39:31:39 - 00:39:31:48
that

00:39:31:48 - 00:39:32:06
you made

00:39:32:06 - 00:39:32:25
yesterday?

00:39:32:25 - 00:39:32:43
Travis?

00:39:32:43 - 00:39:32:49
Had

00:39:32:49 - 00:39:32:54

00:39:33:07 - 00:39:33:27
really good

00:39:33:27 - 00:39:34:06
joke?

00:39:34:31 - 00:39:35:02
That was

00:39:35:02 - 00:39:35:16
not a

00:39:35:16 - 00:39:35:33
really

00:39:35:33 - 00:39:35:43
good

00:39:35:43 - 00:39:36:03
joke.

00:39:36:03 - 00:39:36:12
It's.

00:39:36:12 - 00:39:36:19
It's

00:39:36:19 - 00:39:36:30
just

00:39:36:30 - 00:39:36:46
about

that's

00:40:49:30 - 00:40:49:46

but I

00:40:50:49 - 00:40:50:58

00:40:50:58 - 00:40:51:10
think

00:40:51:10 - 00:40:51:30
all up

00:40:51:30 - 00:40:51:48
or

00:40:51:48 - 00:40:52:13
whatever

00:40:52:13 - 00:40:52:39
thumb

00:40:52:39 - 00:40:52:51
because

00:40:52:51 - 00:40:52:58

00:40:52:58 - 00:40:53:13
thought

00:40:53:13 - 00:40:53:49

00:40:53:49 - 00:40:54:01
I don't

00:40:54:01 - 00:40:54:10
think

00:40:54:10 - 00:40:54:39
he could

00:40:54:48 - 00:40:54:57
have

00:40:54:57 - 00:40:55:13
done

00:40:55:13 - 00:40:55:37
Right.

00:40:55:37 - 00:40:55:58
Right.

00:40:56:29 - 00:40:56:40
Yes.

00:40:56:40 - 00:40:56:51
That's,

00:40:56:51 - 00:40:57:00
that's

00:40:57:00 - 00:40:57:57
my but

00:40:57:57 - 00:40:58:04
I

00:40:58:04 - 00:40:58:12
don't

00:40:58:12 - 00:40:58:15
know

00:40:58:15 - 00:40:58:22
if

00:40:58:22 - 00:40:58:30
it's

00:40:58:30 - 00:40:58:44
good

00:40:58:44 - 00:40:58:58
but

00:40:58:58 - 00:40:59:10
it's

00:40:59:10 - 00:40:59:25
smart

00:40:59:25 - 00:40:59:51
for one.

00:40:59:51 - 00:41:00:08
We want

00:41:00:08 - 00:41:00:49
picture

00:41:00:55 - 00:41:01:37
I think

00:41:01:37 - 00:41:01:47
for

00:41:01:47 - 00:41:02:06
emails

00:41:02:06 - 00:41:02:25
find

00:41:02:25 - 00:41:02:36
this

00:41:02:36 - 00:41:02:47
game

00:41:02:47 - 00:41:02:52
in

00:41:02:52 - 00:41:03:09
general.

All off

00:41:03:48 - 00:41:04:17
Wukong

00:41:04:17 - 00:41:05:06
Zaya

00:41:05:06 - 00:41:05:20
like

00:41:05:20 - 00:41:05:31
I think

00:41:05:31 - 00:41:05:38
it's

00:41:05:38 - 00:41:06:00
a finite

00:41:06:00 - 00:41:06:43
feature,

00:41:06:43 - 00:41:07:04
but

00:41:07:04 - 00:41:07:26
I think

00:41:07:26 - 00:41:07:57
Sunfire

00:41:07:57 - 00:41:08:15
is not

00:41:08:15 - 00:41:08:27
so

00:41:08:27 - 00:41:08:42
nice

00:41:08:42 - 00:41:09:03
item

00:41:09:03 - 00:41:09:16
here.

00:41:09:16 - 00:41:09:30
No,

00:41:09:30 - 00:41:09:45
because

00:41:09:45 - 00:41:10:06
of

00:41:11:04 - 00:41:11:20
lack

00:41:11:20 - 00:41:11:27
of

00:41:11:27 - 00:41:11:47
magic,

00:41:11:47 - 00:41:12:00
some

00:41:12:00 - 00:41:12:18
of

00:41:12:32 - 00:41:12:41
the

00:41:12:41 - 00:41:13:24
scum

00:41:15:00 - 00:41:15:37
damage

00:41:15:37 - 00:41:16:19
total

00:41:16:19 - 00:41:17:06
is

00:41:17:38 - 00:41:18:28
brutal

00:41:18:43 - 00:41:18:52
is

00:41:18:52 - 00:41:19:17
what

00:41:19:17 - 00:41:19:32
I think

00:41:19:32 - 00:41:19:42
it's

00:41:19:42 - 00:41:20:11
like.

00:41:20:40 - 00:41:20:51
It

00:41:20:51 - 00:41:21:19
was.

00:41:21:48 - 00:41:22:03
Yeah.

00:41:22:03 - 00:41:22:13
Now

00:41:22:13 - 00:41:22:22
it's

00:41:22:22 - 00:41:22:33
low.

00:41:22:33 - 00:41:22:39
It

00:41:22:39 - 00:41:23:13
feels like

00:41:23:13 - 00:41:23:42
love

00:41:23:47 - 00:41:23:54
on

00:41:23:54 - 00:41:24:18
Discord.

00:41:24:18 - 00:41:24:50
Got.

00:41:25:34 - 00:41:26:05
it got

00:41:26:05 - 00:41:26:16
better.

00:41:26:16 - 00:41:26:27
Got

00:41:26:27 - 00:41:26:47
worse

00:41:26:47 - 00:41:26:59
for

00:41:26:59 - 00:41:27:07
all

00:41:27:07 - 00:41:28:01
the time.

00:41:28:35 - 00:41:28:46
I'm

00:41:28:46 - 00:41:28:57
not

00:41:28:57 - 00:41:29:09
going

00:41:29:09 - 00:41:29:18
to

00:41:29:18 - 00:41:29:49
change

00:41:29:49 - 00:41:29:56
the

00:41:29:56 - 00:41:30:22
server

00:41:30:22 - 00:41:30:25
or

00:41:30:25 - 00:41:31:30
something.

00:41:32:06 - 00:41:32:22
We tried

00:41:32:22 - 00:41:32:25
to

00:41:32:25 - 00:41:32:40
figure

00:41:32:40 - 00:41:32:54
out

00:41:33:36 - 00:41:33:52
where

00:41:33:52 - 00:41:34:42
thermal

00:41:34:42 - 00:41:35:07
always

00:41:35:07 - 00:41:35:43
40

00:41:35:43 - 00:41:36:18
or 40

00:41:36:18 - 00:41:36:23
if

00:41:36:23 - 00:41:36:30
you'll

00:41:36:30 - 00:41:36:59
see it

00:41:36:59 - 00:41:37:08
and

00:41:37:08 - 00:41:37:21
it's

00:41:37:21 - 00:41:37:46
more

00:41:37:46 - 00:41:38:40
mobile

00:41:38:42 - 00:41:39:00
because

00:41:39:00 - 00:41:39:27
the chance

00:41:39:27 - 00:41:39:51
that

00:41:40:13 - 00:41:40:31
okay

00:41:40:31 - 00:41:41:11
now

00:41:41:24 - 00:41:41:40
should be

00:41:41:40 - 00:41:42:09
better.

00:41:42:55 - 00:41:44:29
Oh 68

00:41:44:29 - 00:41:45:05
looks

00:41:45:05 - 00:41:45:30
better

00:41:45:30 - 00:41:46:09
slightly.

00:41:46:09 - 00:41:46:13
It

00:41:46:13 - 00:41:46:28
looks

00:41:46:28 - 00:41:46:55
better

00:41:46:55 - 00:41:47:11
like,

00:41:47:11 - 00:41:48:00
oh no.

00:41:49:44 - 00:41:50:25

Okay.

Yeah.

Three

00:42:01:28 - 00:42:01:48
time.

00:42:01:48 - 00:42:02:06
We seem

00:42:02:06 - 00:42:02:11
to

00:42:02:11 - 00:42:02:50
get them

00:42:02:50 - 00:42:03:09
very

00:42:03:23 - 00:42:03:54
strategically.

00:42:03:54 - 00:42:04:17
Well,

00:42:04:17 - 00:42:04:43
sure.

00:42:05:06 - 00:42:05:24
Pops

00:42:07:57 - 00:42:08:50

00:42:10:13 - 00:42:10:21
me,

00:42:10:21 - 00:42:10:31
it's

00:42:10:31 - 00:42:11:02
fine.

00:42:11:02 - 00:42:11:13
Oh,

00:42:11:13 - 00:42:11:34
it is.

00:42:11:34 - 00:42:11:43
It.

00:42:11:43 - 00:42:12:01
Yeah,

00:42:12:01 - 00:42:12:23
it's

00:42:12:23 - 00:42:12:34
for

00:42:12:34 - 00:42:12:41
me.

00:42:12:41 - 00:42:12:55
It's

00:42:13:19 - 00:42:13:44
like,

00:42:13:44 - 00:42:14:04
okay,

00:42:14:04 - 00:42:14:18
I don't

00:42:14:18 - 00:42:14:27
know.

00:42:14:27 - 00:42:14:36
It's

00:42:14:36 - 00:42:14:45
not,

00:42:14:45 - 00:42:14:54
like,

00:42:14:54 - 00:42:15:14
insane,

00:42:15:14 - 00:42:15:24
but

00:42:15:24 - 00:42:15:32
it's

00:42:16:01 - 00:42:16:15
just.

00:42:16:31 - 00:42:16:54
Yeah,

00:42:17:00 - 00:42:17:13
I mean,

00:42:17:31 - 00:42:17:52
YouTube,

00:42:17:52 - 00:42:18:01
by

00:42:18:01 - 00:42:18:12
the way,

00:42:18:12 - 00:42:18:25
getting

00:42:18:25 - 00:42:18:37
worse.

00:42:18:37 - 00:42:18:46
That's

00:42:18:46 - 00:42:18:54
not

00:42:18:54 - 00:42:19:19
discord

00:42:19:19 - 00:42:19:28
like

00:42:19:28 - 00:42:19:35
right

00:42:19:35 - 00:42:20:07
now.

00:42:20:29 - 00:42:21:05
Oh,

00:42:21:05 - 00:42:21:21
yeah,

00:42:21:21 - 00:42:21:32
that's

00:42:21:32 - 00:42:21:48
YouTube.

00:42:21:48 - 00:42:21:57
That's

00:42:21:57 - 00:42:22:03
not

00:42:22:03 - 00:42:22:42
discord

00:42:22:42 - 00:42:22:46
on

00:42:22:46 - 00:42:22:51
the

00:42:22:51 - 00:42:23:22
side.

00:42:23:22 - 00:42:23:40
Seems

00:42:23:40 - 00:42:23:45
they

00:42:23:45 - 00:42:23:56
can

00:42:23:56 - 00:42:24:07
use

00:42:24:07 - 00:42:24:14
them.

00:42:24:14 - 00:42:24:32
Oh,

00:42:24:32 - 00:42:25:08
well,

00:42:25:21 - 00:42:25:39
now it

00:42:25:39 - 00:42:25:49
got

00:42:25:49 - 00:42:26:25
disgusting.

00:42:26:25 - 00:42:26:38
Now

00:42:26:38 - 00:42:26:58
it's like

00:42:26:58 - 00:42:27:12
yeah,

00:42:27:12 - 00:42:27:23
it's

00:42:27:23 - 00:42:27:46
gross.

00:42:27:46 - 00:42:27:55
It's

00:42:27:55 - 00:42:28:14
gross

00:42:28:14 - 00:42:28:21
right

00:42:28:21 - 00:42:28:33
now.

00:42:28:33 - 00:42:28:55
Yeah,

00:42:28:55 - 00:42:29:18
yeah,

00:42:29:18 - 00:42:29:37
yeah.

00:42:29:37 - 00:42:29:49
It's

00:42:30:37 - 00:42:30:59
Does

00:42:30:59 - 00:42:32:07
the adults

00:42:32:07 - 00:42:32:20
go

00:42:32:20 - 00:42:32:51
the.

00:42:32:56 - 00:42:33:25
I see

00:42:33:25 - 00:42:33:37
quite

00:42:33:37 - 00:42:33:41
a

00:42:33:41 - 00:42:34:19
little pixel,

00:42:34:19 - 00:42:34:30
so

00:42:34:30 - 00:42:34:39
it's

00:42:34:39 - 00:42:35:13
fine

00:42:35:13 - 00:42:35:20
for

00:42:35:20 - 00:42:35:49
the one.

00:42:35:49 - 00:42:36:10
Holy

00:42:36:10 - 00:42:36:43
shit.

00:42:36:43 - 00:42:37:19
Well,

00:42:37:19 - 00:42:37:40
that.

00:42:37:46 - 00:42:38:09
Oh,

00:42:38:16 - 00:42:38:38
oh,

00:42:38:40 - 00:42:39:55
oh, oh

00:42:39:55 - 00:42:40:48
bomb.

00:42:40:51 - 00:42:41:05
Oh,

00:42:42:43 - 00:42:43:03
yeah.

00:42:43:44 - 00:42:44:00
All

00:42:44:04 - 00:42:44:18
of is

00:42:44:18 - 00:42:44:51
super

00:42:44:51 - 00:42:46:12
consumable

00:42:46:12 - 00:42:46:42
like,

00:42:46:42 - 00:42:47:20
oh,

00:42:47:20 - 00:42:48:12
toenails,

00:42:48:12 - 00:42:48:28
but

00:42:48:28 - 00:42:49:13
biogas

00:42:49:13 - 00:42:49:19
of

00:42:49:19 - 00:42:49:40
thermal.

00:42:49:40 - 00:42:49:55
Yeah.

00:42:49:55 - 00:42:50:04
There

00:42:50:04 - 00:42:50:33
it is.

00:42:50:33 - 00:42:50:43
There

00:42:50:43 - 00:42:50:58
it is

00:42:50:58 - 00:42:51:22
back.

00:42:51:27 - 00:42:51:41
I'll

00:42:52:05 - 00:42:52:19
be

00:42:52:36 - 00:42:52:48
good

00:42:52:48 - 00:42:53:00
bye

00:42:53:00 - 00:42:53:22
versus.

00:42:53:22 - 00:42:53:31
Oh

00:42:53:31 - 00:42:53:40
there's

00:42:53:40 - 00:42:53:51
no

00:42:53:51 - 00:42:54:02
like

00:42:54:02 - 00:42:54:37
Yeah,

00:42:54:45 - 00:42:55:03
there's

00:42:55:03 - 00:42:55:12
the

00:42:55:12 - 00:42:56:02
small problem.

00:42:56:02 - 00:42:57:00
This is the bow

00:42:57:00 - 00:42:57:36
but

00:42:58:10 - 00:42:58:33
okay.

00:42:58:33 - 00:42:58:57
Yeah

00:42:58:57 - 00:42:59:09
that's,

00:42:59:09 - 00:42:59:18
that's

00:42:59:18 - 00:42:59:43
enough.

00:42:59:43 - 00:43:00:07
I guess

00:43:00:07 - 00:43:00:18
that's

00:43:00:18 - 00:43:00:37
enough.

00:43:00:37 - 00:43:00:52
Yeah.

00:43:00:52 - 00:43:01:10
I guess

00:43:01:10 - 00:43:01:17
it's

00:43:01:17 - 00:43:01:22
the

00:43:01:22 - 00:43:01:55
most

00:43:01:58 - 00:43:02:09
not

00:43:02:09 - 00:43:02:49
necessary.

00:43:02:49 - 00:43:03:14
Like

00:43:03:25 - 00:43:03:34
he's

00:43:03:34 - 00:43:04:21
all he

00:43:04:21 - 00:43:04:42
probably

00:43:04:42 - 00:43:04:59
has

00:43:05:15 - 00:43:05:29
built

00:43:05:29 - 00:43:05:49
for it

00:43:05:49 - 00:43:06:10
actually.

00:43:06:10 - 00:43:06:18
He

00:43:06:18 - 00:43:06:37
probably

00:43:06:37 - 00:43:06:45
had

00:43:06:45 - 00:43:06:52
like

00:43:06:52 - 00:43:07:21
Yeah,

00:43:07:40 - 00:43:08:02
that's

00:43:08:02 - 00:43:09:09
my feeling.

00:43:09:09 - 00:43:09:16
So

00:43:09:16 - 00:43:09:25
that's

00:43:09:25 - 00:43:09:32
not

00:43:09:32 - 00:43:09:50
true.

00:43:09:50 - 00:43:10:06
Maybe

00:43:10:06 - 00:43:11:34
that's like,

00:43:12:34 - 00:43:12:55
Oh no,

00:43:12:55 - 00:43:13:03
I

00:43:13:03 - 00:43:13:12
mean,

00:43:13:12 - 00:43:13:19
for

00:43:13:19 - 00:43:13:35
sure.

00:43:13:35 - 00:43:14:02
I like

00:43:14:02 - 00:43:14:33
also

00:43:14:33 - 00:43:14:45
think

00:43:14:45 - 00:43:15:00
some

00:43:15:00 - 00:43:15:19
players

00:43:15:19 - 00:43:15:39
also

00:43:15:39 - 00:43:16:04
know

00:43:16:08 - 00:43:16:21
that's

00:43:16:21 - 00:43:16:35
game,

00:43:16:35 - 00:43:16:46
but

00:43:16:46 - 00:43:17:20
maybe

00:43:17:20 - 00:43:17:34
that's

00:43:17:34 - 00:43:17:43
too

00:43:17:43 - 00:43:18:07
much

00:43:18:07 - 00:43:18:21
or

00:43:18:21 - 00:43:20:27
other TV.

00:43:20:27 - 00:43:20:42
Oh

00:43:20:42 - 00:43:21:10
he went up

00:43:21:10 - 00:43:21:23
this

00:43:21:23 - 00:43:21:32
all

00:43:21:32 - 00:43:21:46
must

00:43:21:46 - 00:43:22:15
come

00:43:22:24 - 00:43:23:21
now to

00:43:23:22 - 00:43:23:36
but

00:43:23:38 - 00:43:23:47
that's

00:43:23:47 - 00:43:23:58
just

00:43:23:58 - 00:43:24:04
the

00:43:24:05 - 00:43:24:48
okay

00:43:24:57 - 00:43:25:12
yeah

00:43:25:12 - 00:43:25:19
that's

00:43:25:19 - 00:43:25:26
what

00:43:25:26 - 00:43:26:20

not bad.

00:43:26:58 - 00:43:27:18
Okay

00:43:31:24 - 00:43:32:00

00:43:57:13 - 00:43:57:30
skill

00:43:57:30 - 00:43:57:43
and

00:43:57:43 - 00:43:58:15
entangle

00:43:58:15 - 00:43:58:33
the guy

00:43:58:33 - 00:43:58:48
player

00:43:58:48 - 00:43:59:13
that

00:43:59:25 - 00:44:00:20
I love.

00:44:00:49 - 00:44:01:06
But

00:44:01:06 - 00:44:01:30
he played

00:44:01:30 - 00:44:01:35
it

00:44:01:35 - 00:44:01:53
fully

00:44:01:53 - 00:44:02:13
fair.

00:44:02:13 - 00:44:02:51
I was not

00:44:02:51 - 00:44:02:58

00:44:02:58 - 00:44:03:14
keen

00:44:03:14 - 00:44:03:54

00:44:06:45 - 00:44:07:01
it has

00:44:07:01 - 00:44:07:13
to be

00:44:07:13 - 00:44:07:42
good.

Oh,

just

00:45:53:06 - 00:45:53:49
throwing.

00:45:54:00 - 00:45:54:36
Oh

00:45:54:36 - 00:45:55:21

00:45:55:21 - 00:45:55:26
And

00:45:55:26 - 00:45:56:09
he couldn't

00:45:56:09 - 00:45:56:27
fight

00:45:56:27 - 00:45:56:45
the way

00:45:56:45 - 00:45:56:52
that

00:45:56:52 - 00:45:57:16
he wants

00:45:57:16 - 00:45:58:10

00:45:58:35 - 00:45:58:58
Wukong

00:45:58:58 - 00:45:59:04
is

00:45:59:04 - 00:45:59:22
thinking

00:45:59:22 - 00:45:59:36
team

00:45:59:36 - 00:45:59:52
gap

00:45:59:52 - 00:46:00:23
this game

00:46:00:23 - 00:46:00:32
that's

00:46:00:32 - 00:46:00:37
what

00:46:00:37 - 00:46:01:10
it is

00:46:02:16 - 00:46:02:28
and

00:46:03:00 - 00:46:03:18
the fact

00:46:03:18 - 00:46:03:25
that

00:46:03:25 - 00:46:03:30
you

00:46:03:30 - 00:46:03:55
might

00:46:04:48 - 00:46:05:00
not

00:46:05:00 - 00:46:05:20
for

00:46:05:20 - 00:46:06:15
the team

00:46:06:15 - 00:46:07:53
you have to shoot it

00:46:07:53 - 00:46:08:17
that way

00:46:08:17 - 00:46:08:35
to get

00:46:08:35 - 00:46:08:45
like

00:46:08:45 - 00:46:09:01
three

00:46:09:01 - 00:46:09:37
sets

00:46:09:45 - 00:46:10:08
may

00:46:10:08 - 00:46:10:21
not

00:46:10:21 - 00:46:10:26
be

00:46:10:26 - 00:46:10:33
able

00:46:10:33 - 00:46:10:37
to

00:46:10:37 - 00:46:10:51
get up

00:46:10:51 - 00:46:10:57

00:46:10:57 - 00:46:11:11
time

00:46:11:11 - 00:46:11:27

00:46:11:37 - 00:46:11:49
great

00:46:11:49 - 00:46:12:09
challenge.

00:46:12:09 - 00:46:12:30
But

00:46:12:30 - 00:46:12:46
I think

00:46:12:46 - 00:46:13:20
you should

00:46:13:31 - 00:46:13:48
know

00:46:13:48 - 00:46:14:51
this is a massacre.

00:46:14:51 - 00:46:15:30
This game is

00:46:15:30 - 00:46:15:37
going

00:46:15:37 - 00:46:15:41

00:48:15:03 - 00:48:15:14
isn't

00:48:15:14 - 00:48:15:23
even

00:48:15:23 - 00:48:16:03
Australia,

00:48:16:03 - 00:48:16:15
it's

00:48:16:15 - 00:48:16:30

00:48:23:56 - 00:48:24:16

00:48:26:42 - 00:48:28:08
89.

00:48:28:36 - 00:48:28:46
It

00:48:28:58 - 00:48:29:24
nearly

00:48:29:24 - 00:48:29:49
gets

00:48:29:56 - 00:48:30:05
you in

00:48:30:05 - 00:48:30:09

00:48:35:20 - 00:48:37:10

00:48:37:10 - 00:48:37:19
And

00:48:37:19 - 00:48:37:30
then

00:48:37:30 - 00:48:37:39
with

00:48:37:39 - 00:48:38:09
us.

00:48:38:09 - 00:48:38:18
Well,

00:48:42:48 - 00:48:43:04
already

00:48:43:04 - 00:48:43:24

00:49:13:28 - 00:49:13:35
you're

00:49:13:35 - 00:49:13:42
an

00:49:13:42 - 00:49:14:04
artist

00:49:14:04 - 00:49:14:33
and

00:49:15:07 - 00:49:15:18
don't

00:49:15:18 - 00:49:15:28
like

00:49:15:28 - 00:49:15:41
Nick

00:49:15:41 - 00:49:16:21
Draw,

00:49:17:02 - 00:49:17:34
but I

00:49:18:34 - 00:49:19:00
it's

00:49:19:03 - 00:49:19:15
it's

00:49:19:15 - 00:49:19:30
so

00:49:19:30 - 00:49:20:45
disgusting

00:49:20:45 - 00:49:21:09
movie

00:49:22:49 - 00:49:23:19
like

00:49:23:36 - 00:49:24:11
this

00:49:24:14 - 00:49:25:23
blows

00:49:25:23 - 00:49:25:35
up

00:49:25:37 - 00:49:26:15
outside

00:49:26:15 - 00:49:26:56
they don't want

00:49:26:56 - 00:49:27:32
okay

00:49:27:37 - 00:49:27:45
and

00:49:27:45 - 00:49:27:52
what

00:49:27:52 - 00:49:27:59
they

00:49:27:59 - 00:49:28:06
will

00:49:28:06 - 00:49:28:15
just

00:49:28:15 - 00:49:28:24
by

00:49:28:24 - 00:49:28:42
the way

00:49:28:42 - 00:49:29:00
I feel

00:49:29:00 - 00:49:29:11
like

00:49:29:11 - 00:49:29:18
it's

00:49:29:18 - 00:49:29:34
worth

00:49:29:34 - 00:49:30:07
mentioning

00:49:30:07 - 00:49:30:23
because

00:49:30:23 - 00:49:30:36
we've

00:49:30:36 - 00:49:30:45
not

00:49:30:45 - 00:49:31:04
talked

00:49:31:04 - 00:49:31:22
about

00:49:31:22 - 00:49:31:30
the

00:49:31:30 - 00:49:31:48
actual

00:49:31:48 - 00:49:32:02
goal

00:49:32:02 - 00:49:32:24
difference

00:49:32:24 - 00:49:32:31
right

00:49:32:31 - 00:49:32:56
now

00:49:32:56 - 00:49:33:10
it's

00:49:33:10 - 00:49:34:49
10,000

00:49:34:49 - 00:49:34:58
in

00:49:34:58 - 00:49:35:16
favor

00:49:35:16 - 00:49:35:22
of

00:49:35:22 - 00:49:35:47
Belgium

00:49:35:47 - 00:49:36:00
at the

00:49:36:00 - 00:49:36:19
20

00:49:36:19 - 00:49:36:32
minute

00:49:36:32 - 00:49:37:06
mark.

00:49:37:06 - 00:49:37:19
That's

00:49:37:19 - 00:49:37:49
five

00:49:37:49 - 00:49:38:31
10,000

00:49:38:31 - 00:49:38:36
and

00:49:38:36 - 00:49:39:18
favorable

00:49:39:18 - 00:49:39:59
thoughts

00:49:39:59 - 00:49:40:51
ahead

00:49:40:51 - 00:49:41:17
of our

00:49:41:17 - 00:49:41:58
seven

00:49:41:58 - 00:49:42:16
couple

00:49:42:16 - 00:49:42:19
of

00:49:42:19 - 00:49:42:35
words

00:49:42:35 - 00:49:42:46
struck

00:49:42:46 - 00:49:43:03
down

00:49:43:03 - 00:49:43:49
in the game

00:49:43:49 - 00:49:44:54
timer.

00:49:45:00 - 00:49:45:48
I actually thought

00:49:45:48 - 00:49:45:55
it

00:49:45:55 - 00:49:46:08
would be

00:49:46:08 - 00:49:46:13
a

00:49:46:13 - 00:49:46:31
harder

00:49:46:31 - 00:49:46:51
stomp

00:49:46:51 - 00:49:47:00
than

00:49:47:00 - 00:49:47:15
it is

00:49:47:15 - 00:49:47:24
right

00:49:47:24 - 00:49:47:34
now.

00:49:47:34 - 00:49:47:43
You know

00:49:47:43 - 00:49:47:52
what I

00:49:47:52 - 00:49:48:18
mean?

00:49:48:21 - 00:49:48:41
I thought

00:49:48:41 - 00:49:48:50
this

00:49:48:50 - 00:49:48:55
was

00:49:48:55 - 00:49:49:03
going

00:49:49:03 - 00:49:49:10
to be

00:49:49:10 - 00:49:49:21
like

00:49:49:21 - 00:49:50:25
a G2,

00:49:50:25 - 00:49:50:42
like a

00:49:50:42 - 00:49:51:09
G2

00:49:51:09 - 00:49:51:30
stomp

00:49:51:30 - 00:49:51:45
like

00:49:51:45 - 00:49:52:03
under

00:49:52:03 - 00:49:52:28
20.

00:49:52:28 - 00:49:52:40
You know

00:49:52:40 - 00:49:52:46
what

00:49:52:46 - 00:49:53:15
I mean?

00:49:53:18 - 00:49:53:34
Like

00:49:53:34 - 00:49:53:43
you

00:49:53:43 - 00:49:54:03
said.

00:49:54:12 - 00:49:54:32
Yeah,

00:49:54:32 - 00:49:54:45
but

00:49:54:45 - 00:49:55:41
I think

00:49:55:41 - 00:49:56:01
I think

00:49:56:01 - 00:49:56:11
they

00:49:56:11 - 00:49:56:29
think

00:49:56:29 - 00:49:56:40
like,

00:49:56:40 - 00:49:56:52
I'm

00:49:56:52 - 00:49:57:46
pretty

00:49:57:47 - 00:49:58:10
clinical,

00:49:58:10 - 00:49:58:19
too.

00:49:58:19 - 00:49:58:28
I

00:49:58:28 - 00:49:58:37
know.

00:49:58:37 - 00:49:59:02
Like,

00:49:59:31 - 00:49:59:56
this is a

00:49:59:56 - 00:50:00:25
pretty

00:50:00:25 - 00:50:00:48
fucking

00:50:00:48 - 00:50:01:12
solid

00:50:01:12 - 00:50:01:39
stomp

00:50:01:39 - 00:50:02:07
no

00:50:02:07 - 00:50:03:03
at the is,

00:50:03:03 - 00:50:03:19
but

00:50:03:19 - 00:50:03:39
I think

00:50:03:39 - 00:50:03:48
it's

00:50:03:48 - 00:50:04:13
just

00:50:04:13 - 00:50:04:21
I

00:50:04:21 - 00:50:04:49
think

00:50:04:49 - 00:50:05:04
we're

00:50:05:04 - 00:50:05:16
just

00:50:05:16 - 00:50:05:54
overthinking

00:50:05:54 - 00:50:06:25
over here

00:50:06:25 - 00:50:06:41
because

00:50:06:41 - 00:50:07:13
we want

00:50:07:13 - 00:50:07:30
to be

00:50:07:30 - 00:50:07:48
like

00:50:07:48 - 00:50:08:18
ditto

00:50:08:18 - 00:50:08:48
G2.

00:50:09:05 - 00:50:09:27
Yeah,

00:50:09:27 - 00:50:10:01
competitive

00:50:10:01 - 00:50:10:32
stuff.

00:50:10:34 - 00:50:10:46
So

00:50:10:46 - 00:50:11:07
it's

00:50:11:13 - 00:50:11:49
yeah

00:50:12:10 - 00:50:12:54
yeah

00:50:12:54 - 00:50:13:33
for my

00:50:13:33 - 00:50:14:02
butt

00:50:14:07 - 00:50:14:16
but

00:50:14:16 - 00:50:14:24
he's

00:50:14:24 - 00:50:14:51
not is

00:50:14:51 - 00:50:15:10
super.

00:50:15:10 - 00:50:15:51
How's

00:50:15:55 - 00:50:16:03
the

00:50:16:03 - 00:50:16:53
coach.

00:50:16:58 - 00:50:17:15
Yeah

00:50:17:15 - 00:50:17:58
third

00:50:18:01 - 00:50:18:46
team

00:50:18:46 - 00:50:19:13
halfway

00:50:19:13 - 00:50:19:28
through

00:50:19:28 - 00:50:20:07
the Oh

00:50:20:07 - 00:50:20:51
my Lord

00:50:20:51 - 00:50:21:30
man

00:50:21:39 - 00:50:21:50
it's

00:50:21:50 - 00:50:22:10
around

00:50:22:10 - 00:50:22:21
the

00:50:22:21 - 00:50:22:35
neck.

00:50:22:35 - 00:50:22:48
What

00:50:22:48 - 00:50:23:20
if you

00:50:23:20 - 00:50:23:36
went

00:50:23:36 - 00:50:24:01
Zuma?

00:50:25:04 - 00:50:26:01
Messi.

00:50:26:40 - 00:50:27:09
Yeah.

00:50:27:09 - 00:50:27:21
Oh,

00:50:27:21 - 00:50:27:34
no.

00:50:27:48 - 00:50:27:57
I

00:50:27:57 - 00:50:28:06
think

00:50:28:06 - 00:50:28:12
it's

00:50:28:12 - 00:50:28:19
going

00:50:28:19 - 00:50:28:26
to be

00:50:28:26 - 00:50:28:49
crazy

00:50:28:49 - 00:50:30:00
if you into Messi

00:50:30:00 - 00:50:30:19
because

00:50:30:19 - 00:50:32:00
one G2

00:50:32:00 - 00:50:32:16
isn't

00:50:32:16 - 00:50:32:29
even

00:50:32:29 - 00:50:32:34
the

00:50:32:34 - 00:50:32:51
second

00:50:32:51 - 00:50:33:01
best

00:50:33:01 - 00:50:33:14
team

00:50:33:14 - 00:50:33:19
in

00:50:33:19 - 00:50:33:37
Europe

00:50:33:37 - 00:50:33:46
right

00:50:33:46 - 00:50:34:19
now.

00:50:34:19 - 00:50:34:33
Like,

00:50:34:33 - 00:50:34:53
right

00:50:34:53 - 00:50:35:29
now.

00:50:35:34 - 00:50:36:25
Uh,

00:50:36:36 - 00:50:36:39
I

00:50:36:39 - 00:50:37:01
mean,

00:50:37:28 - 00:50:38:15
oh,

00:50:38:40 - 00:50:38:43
I

00:50:38:43 - 00:50:38:51
mean,

00:50:38:51 - 00:50:38:58
they're

00:50:38:58 - 00:50:39:10
not

00:50:39:10 - 00:50:39:27
media

00:50:39:27 - 00:50:39:57
circus

00:50:39:57 - 00:50:40:40
organizations,

00:50:40:40 - 00:50:40:49
but

00:50:40:49 - 00:50:41:27
as they're,

00:50:41:27 - 00:50:41:34
you

00:50:41:47 - 00:50:42:23
know.

00:50:42:27 - 00:50:43:01
Yeah,

00:50:43:01 - 00:50:43:08
I

00:50:43:08 - 00:50:43:17
don't

00:50:43:17 - 00:50:43:22
know.

00:50:43:22 - 00:50:43:37
Yeah,

00:50:43:37 - 00:50:43:46
I

00:50:43:46 - 00:50:43:55
don't

00:50:43:55 - 00:50:44:02
know.

00:50:44:02 - 00:50:44:24
Probably

00:50:44:24 - 00:50:44:36
is.

00:50:44:36 - 00:50:44:49
Yeah,

00:50:44:49 - 00:50:45:09
I

00:50:45:09 - 00:50:45:19
don't.

00:50:45:19 - 00:50:45:37
Yeah.

00:50:45:37 - 00:50:45:52
I mean

00:50:45:52 - 00:50:45:57
I

00:50:45:57 - 00:50:46:08
think,

00:50:46:08 - 00:50:46:13
I

00:50:46:13 - 00:50:46:23
think

00:50:46:23 - 00:50:46:51
CBS is

00:50:46:51 - 00:50:47:04
that

00:50:47:15 - 00:50:47:47
it's

00:50:47:52 - 00:50:48:28
you always

00:50:48:28 - 00:50:48:46
sound

00:50:48:46 - 00:50:49:10
biased

00:50:49:10 - 00:50:49:17
when

00:50:49:17 - 00:50:49:37
you say

00:50:49:37 - 00:50:49:51
that

00:50:49:51 - 00:50:50:34
you know

00:50:50:45 - 00:50:51:05
it's

00:50:51:05 - 00:50:51:32
I mean

00:50:51:32 - 00:50:52:24
I like

00:50:52:24 - 00:50:52:49
seeing

00:50:52:49 - 00:50:53:46
you,

00:50:53:46 - 00:50:54:21
you know

00:50:54:21 - 00:50:55:06
Yeah.

00:50:55:06 - 00:50:55:31
Lions

00:50:55:31 - 00:50:56:07
in a

00:50:56:07 - 00:50:56:52
little too

00:50:56:52 - 00:50:57:16
This is how

00:50:57:16 - 00:50:57:30
it is

00:50:57:30 - 00:50:58:03
though

00:50:58:12 - 00:50:59:00
catch you

00:50:59:40 - 00:51:00:00
but

00:51:00:00 - 00:51:00:27
I think

00:51:00:27 - 00:51:01:12
G2

00:51:01:12 - 00:51:01:26
would

00:51:01:26 - 00:51:01:53
perform

00:51:01:53 - 00:51:02:11
better

00:51:02:11 - 00:51:02:45
Messi

00:51:02:45 - 00:51:03:25
then

00:51:03:25 - 00:51:04:01
beats

00:51:04:01 - 00:51:04:58
would

00:51:05:00 - 00:51:05:09
if

00:51:05:09 - 00:51:05:27
that makes

00:51:05:27 - 00:51:06:12
sense.

00:51:06:12 - 00:51:06:28
It's

00:51:06:28 - 00:51:06:52
always

00:51:06:52 - 00:51:07:04
been

00:51:07:04 - 00:51:07:12
an

00:51:07:12 - 00:51:07:39
aggressive

00:51:07:39 - 00:51:07:58
80

00:51:07:58 - 00:51:08:39
curry

00:51:08:56 - 00:51:09:23
I think

00:51:09:23 - 00:51:09:43
I think

00:51:09:43 - 00:51:10:39
G2

00:51:10:40 - 00:51:11:14
yeah

00:51:11:24 - 00:51:11:41
just

00:51:11:41 - 00:51:12:00
just

00:51:12:00 - 00:51:12:09
so

00:51:12:09 - 00:51:12:21
know

00:51:12:21 - 00:51:12:37
else

00:51:12:37 - 00:51:13:08
I got the reverse

00:51:13:08 - 00:51:13:48
slap

00:51:13:48 - 00:51:14:31
in my face

00:51:14:31 - 00:51:15:39
let them know

00:51:15:39 - 00:51:15:54
what

00:51:16:03 - 00:51:16:28
somebody

00:51:16:28 - 00:51:16:42
said

00:51:16:42 - 00:51:16:55
at

00:51:16:55 - 00:51:17:13
first.

00:51:17:13 - 00:51:17:34
But

00:51:17:58 - 00:51:18:40
before

00:51:18:53 - 00:51:19:08
I

00:51:20:31 - 00:51:20:38
do

00:51:20:38 - 00:51:21:25
this,

00:51:21:52 - 00:51:21:57
you

00:51:21:57 - 00:51:22:16
know,

00:51:22:53 - 00:51:23:02
it's

00:51:23:02 - 00:51:23:27
not

00:51:23:31 - 00:51:23:42
good

00:51:23:42 - 00:51:23:51
for

00:51:23:51 - 00:51:25:26
the sport.

00:51:25:26 - 00:51:25:40
Just

00:51:25:40 - 00:51:25:49
not

00:51:25:49 - 00:51:26:10
though.

00:51:26:13 - 00:51:26:24
I

00:51:26:24 - 00:51:26:36
mean,

00:51:26:36 - 00:51:26:45
I

00:51:26:45 - 00:51:26:52
don't

00:51:26:52 - 00:51:27:19
know.

00:51:27:19 - 00:51:27:39
I'm to

00:51:27:39 - 00:51:27:48
be

00:51:27:48 - 00:51:28:13
honest.

00:51:28:13 - 00:51:29:22
I think

00:51:29:22 - 00:51:29:54
I

00:51:29:54 - 00:51:30:32
personally

00:51:30:32 - 00:51:30:46
have

00:51:30:46 - 00:51:31:40
more

00:51:32:13 - 00:51:32:33
faith

00:51:32:33 - 00:51:33:12
in G2

00:51:33:12 - 00:51:33:24
than

00:51:33:24 - 00:51:33:41
to be

00:51:33:41 - 00:51:33:59
this

00:51:33:59 - 00:51:34:06
one

00:51:34:06 - 00:51:34:24
to my.

00:51:34:24 - 00:51:34:57
SO,

00:51:35:29 - 00:51:35:36
you

00:51:35:36 - 00:51:36:01
know.

00:51:36:07 - 00:51:36:23
Yeah,

00:51:36:23 - 00:51:36:41
I do,

00:51:36:41 - 00:51:36:50
too.

00:51:36:50 - 00:51:37:12
That's

00:51:37:12 - 00:51:37:21
that's

00:51:37:21 - 00:51:37:26
no,

00:51:37:26 - 00:51:37:35
I was

00:51:37:35 - 00:51:37:44
just

00:51:37:44 - 00:51:38:27
saying

00:51:38:27 - 00:51:38:40
I

00:51:38:40 - 00:51:38:56
think.

00:51:38:56 - 00:51:39:34
Right.

00:51:39:50 - 00:51:40:06
Yeah,

00:51:40:06 - 00:51:40:17
that's

00:51:40:17 - 00:51:40:24
what I

00:51:40:24 - 00:51:40:31
was

00:51:40:31 - 00:51:40:51
saying.

00:51:40:51 - 00:51:41:02
So

00:51:41:02 - 00:51:41:29
I think

00:51:41:29 - 00:51:41:38
that

00:51:41:38 - 00:51:42:01
beats

00:51:42:01 - 00:51:42:10
is

00:51:42:10 - 00:51:42:30
better

00:51:42:30 - 00:51:42:41
than

00:51:42:41 - 00:51:43:26
G2,

00:51:43:26 - 00:51:43:44
but I

00:51:43:44 - 00:51:43:57
think

00:51:43:57 - 00:51:44:22
G2

00:51:44:22 - 00:51:44:29
would

00:51:44:29 - 00:51:44:58
perform

00:51:44:58 - 00:51:45:12
better.

00:51:45:12 - 00:51:45:39
Adams

00:51:45:39 - 00:51:46:35
Oh,

00:51:46:35 - 00:51:47:27
okay.

00:51:47:27 - 00:51:47:43
I

00:51:47:43 - 00:51:47:56
get

00:51:47:56 - 00:51:48:01
it.

00:51:48:01 - 00:51:48:19
No,

00:51:48:19 - 00:51:49:08
I disagree

00:51:49:08 - 00:51:49:13
with

00:51:49:13 - 00:51:49:22
that,

00:51:49:22 - 00:51:49:48
though.

00:51:49:58 - 00:51:50:10
Oh,

00:51:50:10 - 00:51:50:50
okay.

00:51:52:28 - 00:51:53:15
Okay.

00:51:53:15 - 00:51:53:29
Oh,

00:51:53:29 - 00:51:53:58
no,

00:51:54:10 - 00:51:54:25
I'm

00:51:54:25 - 00:51:54:37
not

00:51:54:37 - 00:51:54:56
saying

00:51:54:56 - 00:51:55:21
get out

00:51:55:21 - 00:51:55:39
of it.

00:51:55:39 - 00:51:55:55
Like,

00:51:55:55 - 00:51:56:45
honestly,

00:51:56:58 - 00:51:57:18
no,

00:51:58:15 - 00:51:58:50
sorry.

00:51:59:00 - 00:51:59:22
Okay.

00:51:59:22 - 00:51:59:40
All right.

00:51:59:40 - 00:52:00:27
Whatever

00:52:00:37 - 00:52:01:01
team

00:52:01:01 - 00:52:01:26
that

00:52:02:54 - 00:52:03:52
will become.

00:52:03:52 - 00:52:04:28
All right.

00:52:04:55 - 00:52:04:58
I,

00:52:04:58 - 00:52:06:09
I go,

00:52:06:09 - 00:52:06:28
Whoa,

00:52:06:28 - 00:52:06:39
whoa.

00:52:06:39 - 00:52:06:45
If

00:52:06:45 - 00:52:07:18
you're

00:52:07:52 - 00:52:08:04
going

00:52:08:21 - 00:52:08:54
to say

00:52:08:54 - 00:52:09:27
about

00:52:09:36 - 00:52:10:27
oh,

00:52:10:39 - 00:52:11:26
oh,

00:52:11:38 - 00:52:12:04
well,

00:52:12:09 - 00:52:12:23
well,

00:52:12:23 - 00:52:13:04
this was

00:52:13:04 - 00:52:13:10
the

00:52:13:10 - 00:52:13:48
first item

00:52:13:48 - 00:52:13:55
on.

00:52:13:55 - 00:52:14:07
Now

00:52:14:07 - 00:52:14:27
tell us

00:52:14:27 - 00:52:14:42
what

00:52:14:42 - 00:52:15:00
you feel

00:52:15:00 - 00:52:15:28
like.

00:52:15:39 - 00:52:16:13
This game.

00:52:16:13 - 00:52:17:18
Redemption.

00:52:17:20 - 00:52:17:33
They're

00:52:17:33 - 00:52:18:09
happy.

00:52:18:09 - 00:52:18:34
Yeah,

00:52:18:34 - 00:52:18:54
I think.

00:52:18:54 - 00:52:19:03
Is

00:52:19:03 - 00:52:19:28
this

00:52:19:28 - 00:52:20:16
stuff.

00:52:20:16 - 00:52:20:31
Yeah,

00:52:20:31 - 00:52:20:49
stuff.

00:52:20:49 - 00:52:21:10
This

00:52:21:23 - 00:52:21:39
stuff

00:52:21:39 - 00:52:21:46
is

00:52:21:46 - 00:52:21:59
really

00:52:21:59 - 00:52:22:07
good,

00:52:22:07 - 00:52:22:22
too.

00:52:22:22 - 00:52:22:39
Staff

00:52:22:39 - 00:52:22:44
is

00:52:22:44 - 00:52:22:55
really

00:52:22:55 - 00:52:23:02
good,

00:52:23:02 - 00:52:23:16
too.

00:52:23:16 - 00:52:23:28
Yeah.

00:52:23:28 - 00:52:23:52
Yeah.

00:52:23:52 - 00:52:24:05
But

00:52:24:05 - 00:52:24:27
not.

00:52:24:27 - 00:52:24:50
Yeah,

00:52:24:50 - 00:52:25:03
my

00:52:25:03 - 00:52:25:30
accent.

00:52:25:30 - 00:52:25:48
Maybe

00:52:25:48 - 00:52:26:36
on this one.

00:52:26:36 - 00:52:27:02
I just

00:52:27:02 - 00:52:27:19
then

00:52:27:19 - 00:52:27:25
have

00:52:27:25 - 00:52:27:32
two

00:52:27:32 - 00:52:27:52
fingers

00:52:27:52 - 00:52:28:37
tenderloin

00:52:28:37 - 00:52:28:57
so

00:52:28:57 - 00:52:29:40
it doesn't,

00:52:29:40 - 00:52:29:45
it

00:52:29:45 - 00:52:30:01
gives them

00:52:30:01 - 00:52:30:21
ability

00:52:30:21 - 00:52:30:43
here.

00:52:30:43 - 00:52:30:59
I mean

00:52:30:59 - 00:52:31:26
as he

00:52:31:26 - 00:52:31:33
has

00:52:31:33 - 00:52:32:02
100%

00:52:32:02 - 00:52:32:15
AP

00:52:32:15 - 00:52:32:34
ratio

00:52:32:34 - 00:52:33:32
and w

00:52:33:50 - 00:52:33:59
he

00:52:33:59 - 00:52:34:19
does.

00:52:34:19 - 00:52:35:02
Okay.

00:52:35:04 - 00:52:35:18
Yeah.

00:52:35:18 - 00:52:35:25
There

00:52:35:25 - 00:52:35:54
you go.

00:52:35:54 - 00:52:36:09
Maybe

00:52:36:09 - 00:52:36:23
he gets

00:52:36:23 - 00:52:36:30
two

00:52:36:30 - 00:52:37:01
WS off

00:52:37:01 - 00:52:37:06
in

00:52:37:06 - 00:52:37:21
a team

00:52:37:21 - 00:52:37:35
fight

00:52:37:35 - 00:52:37:58
boom

00:52:37:58 - 00:52:38:13
hundred

00:52:38:13 - 00:52:38:56
HP.

00:52:39:09 - 00:52:39:41
Oh,

00:52:39:41 - 00:52:39:55
boy.

00:52:39:55 - 00:52:40:31
Listen.

00:52:40:49 - 00:52:40:58
Well,

00:52:40:58 - 00:52:41:04
at

00:52:41:04 - 00:52:41:15
least

00:52:41:15 - 00:52:42:09
instead

00:52:42:19 - 00:52:42:46
perhaps

00:52:42:46 - 00:52:43:03
it's.

00:52:43:13 - 00:52:43:43
Oh,

00:52:43:57 - 00:52:44:27
Mexico

00:52:44:27 - 00:52:44:36
will

00:52:44:36 - 00:52:44:58
not be

00:52:44:58 - 00:52:45:48
silent.

00:52:45:48 - 00:52:46:01
That's

00:52:46:01 - 00:52:46:28
hostile

00:52:46:28 - 00:52:46:37
and

00:52:46:37 - 00:52:46:58
vicious.

00:52:46:58 - 00:52:47:20
So.

00:52:47:20 - 00:52:47:43
Yeah.

00:52:47:43 - 00:52:48:07
Yeah.

00:52:48:07 - 00:52:48:34
Well

00:52:48:38 - 00:52:48:55
being

00:52:48:55 - 00:52:49:13
a

Yeah,

00:52:50:25 - 00:52:51:09
I know.

00:52:51:09 - 00:52:51:30
Make it

00:52:51:30 - 00:52:51:46

00:52:51:46 - 00:52:52:26
seven.

00:52:52:26 - 00:52:52:48
They'll have

00:52:52:48 - 00:52:52:55
some

00:52:52:55 - 00:52:53:27
of them

00:52:53:27 - 00:52:53:43
at this

00:52:53:43 - 00:52:54:16
point.

00:52:54:16 - 00:52:54:52
Yeah.

00:52:54:57 - 00:52:55:21
Oh, my

00:52:57:41 - 00:52:57:52
this

00:52:57:52 - 00:52:58:40
situation?

00:52:58:40 - 00:52:58:49
Well,

00:52:58:49 - 00:52:59:02
what

00:52:59:02 - 00:52:59:22
happened

00:52:59:22 - 00:52:59:33

00:53:00:01 - 00:53:01:03
embrace

00:53:01:03 - 00:53:01:31
mirrors.

00:53:01:31 - 00:53:01:58
Yeah,

00:53:01:58 - 00:53:02:15
demonic

00:53:02:15 - 00:53:02:31
embrace

00:53:02:31 - 00:53:02:36
would

00:53:02:36 - 00:53:02:42
be

00:53:02:42 - 00:53:02:52
really

00:53:02:52 - 00:53:03:00
good,

00:53:03:00 - 00:53:03:14
too,

00:53:03:14 - 00:53:03:19
I

00:53:03:19 - 00:53:03:32
guess.

00:53:03:32 - 00:53:03:41
He has

00:53:03:41 - 00:53:04:01
so much

00:53:04:01 - 00:53:04:51
HP

00:53:04:57 - 00:53:05:29
back

00:53:05:29 - 00:53:06:01
towards

00:53:06:03 - 00:53:06:18
the

00:53:06:18 - 00:53:06:30
such

00:53:06:30 - 00:53:06:39
high

00:53:06:39 - 00:53:06:52
HP

00:53:06:52 - 00:53:07:21
ratios.

00:53:07:21 - 00:53:07:26
I

00:53:07:26 - 00:53:07:33
mean,

00:53:07:33 - 00:53:07:39
I

00:53:07:39 - 00:53:08:25
guess

00:53:08:25 - 00:53:08:40
it's

00:53:08:40 - 00:53:08:51
just

00:53:08:51 - 00:53:09:01
like

00:53:09:01 - 00:53:09:18
he's

00:53:09:18 - 00:53:09:37
not

00:53:09:37 - 00:53:10:04
getting

00:53:10:04 - 00:53:10:28
gold

00:53:10:28 - 00:53:11:15
anymore,

00:53:11:15 - 00:53:11:27
you know

00:53:11:27 - 00:53:11:34
what I

00:53:11:34 - 00:53:12:07
mean?

00:53:12:09 - 00:53:12:27
And as

00:53:12:27 - 00:53:12:41
a way

00:53:12:41 - 00:53:12:54
to get

00:53:12:54 - 00:53:13:01
over.

00:53:13:01 - 00:53:13:26
Yeah.

00:53:13:26 - 00:53:13:41
No.

00:53:13:41 - 00:53:13:57
Yeah.

00:53:14:11 - 00:53:14:43
You want to get

00:53:14:43 - 00:53:15:00
this

00:53:15:00 - 00:53:15:10
this

00:53:15:10 - 00:53:15:23
other

00:53:15:23 - 00:53:15:43
though.

00:53:15:43 - 00:53:16:17
Oh no.

00:53:16:17 - 00:53:16:24
No

00:53:16:24 - 00:53:16:37
matter

00:53:16:37 - 00:53:17:00
what,

00:53:17:00 - 00:53:17:31
he should

00:53:17:31 - 00:53:18:14
get a

00:53:18:14 - 00:53:18:31
target

00:53:18:31 - 00:53:18:41
on

00:53:18:41 - 00:53:18:50
right

00:53:18:50 - 00:53:19:13
now,

00:53:19:13 - 00:53:19:24
no

00:53:19:24 - 00:53:19:37
matter

00:53:19:37 - 00:53:20:13
what.

00:53:20:13 - 00:53:20:31
I think

00:53:20:31 - 00:53:20:38
it's

00:53:20:38 - 00:53:20:51
fair

00:53:20:51 - 00:53:21:37
to say

00:53:21:37 - 00:53:21:51
that

00:53:22:03 - 00:53:22:17
because

00:53:22:17 - 00:53:22:37
every

00:53:22:37 - 00:53:22:55
Minion

00:53:22:55 - 00:53:23:13
Wave

00:53:23:13 - 00:53:23:24
is

00:53:23:24 - 00:53:24:10
a cannon

00:53:24:10 - 00:53:24:25
so

00:53:24:25 - 00:53:24:41
he can

00:53:24:41 - 00:53:25:13
stack it

00:53:25:13 - 00:53:25:30
so

00:53:25:30 - 00:53:26:15
quick.

00:53:26:15 - 00:53:26:29
No,

00:53:26:29 - 00:53:27:03
no, I

00:53:27:03 - 00:53:27:25
could,

00:53:27:25 - 00:53:27:46
like,

00:53:27:52 - 00:53:28:15
toggle

00:53:28:15 - 00:53:28:48
this

00:53:28:53 - 00:53:29:07
part.

00:53:29:07 - 00:53:29:29
Yeah.

00:53:29:31 - 00:53:29:52
Nautilus

00:53:29:52 - 00:53:30:01
should

00:53:30:01 - 00:53:30:10
pick

00:53:30:10 - 00:53:30:16
up

00:53:30:16 - 00:53:30:28
Target

00:53:30:28 - 00:53:30:37
on

00:53:30:37 - 00:53:31:06
here.

00:53:31:06 - 00:53:31:33
Yeah.

00:53:31:33 - 00:53:31:53
Yeah,

00:53:31:53 - 00:53:32:27
that's

00:53:32:27 - 00:53:33:00
true.

00:53:33:14 - 00:53:33:34
But

00:53:33:34 - 00:53:34:06
nobody

00:53:34:06 - 00:53:34:14
will

00:53:34:14 - 00:53:34:24
go

00:53:34:24 - 00:53:34:35
that

00:53:34:35 - 00:53:34:53
that's.

00:53:34:53 - 00:53:35:16
Yeah,

00:53:35:16 - 00:53:35:36
yeah,

00:53:35:36 - 00:53:35:54
yeah.

00:53:35:54 - 00:53:37:04
Reality.

00:53:37:21 - 00:53:37:26
Know

00:53:37:26 - 00:53:37:37
what's

00:53:37:37 - 00:53:37:46
this

00:53:37:46 - 00:53:38:00
guy's

00:53:38:00 - 00:53:38:29
name

00:53:38:29 - 00:53:39:16
the Korean

00:53:39:16 - 00:53:40:13
Eddie

00:53:40:13 - 00:53:40:37
Fish

00:53:40:37 - 00:53:40:51
just

00:53:40:51 - 00:53:41:13
been.

00:53:41:20 - 00:53:41:38
Oh

00:53:41:38 - 00:53:42:17
yeah.

00:53:42:17 - 00:53:42:30
That

00:53:43:35 - 00:53:43:53
right.

00:53:43:53 - 00:53:44:13
Yeah.

00:53:44:13 - 00:53:44:29
That's

00:53:44:29 - 00:53:44:38
good.

00:53:44:38 - 00:53:45:00
That's

00:53:45:16 - 00:53:45:25
a bit

00:53:45:25 - 00:53:45:34
of an

00:53:45:34 - 00:53:46:08
earthquake.

00:53:46:08 - 00:53:46:26
Yeah,

00:53:46:26 - 00:53:46:37
but

00:53:46:37 - 00:53:46:49
that's

00:53:46:49 - 00:53:47:22
certainly

00:53:47:31 - 00:53:47:42
like

00:53:47:42 - 00:53:47:52
that

00:53:47:52 - 00:53:48:18
guy

00:53:48:18 - 00:53:48:34
looked

00:53:48:34 - 00:53:48:55
at it.

00:53:48:55 - 00:53:49:08
Like

00:53:49:08 - 00:53:49:24
when I

00:53:49:24 - 00:53:49:37
watch

00:53:49:37 - 00:53:50:06
content

00:53:50:06 - 00:53:50:15
is

00:53:50:15 - 00:53:50:29
actually

00:53:50:29 - 00:53:51:03
sloth.

00:53:51:03 - 00:53:52:19
I really

00:53:52:19 - 00:53:52:30
like

00:53:52:30 - 00:53:52:40
one

00:53:52:40 - 00:53:53:07
more

00:53:53:27 - 00:53:53:45
present.

00:53:53:45 - 00:53:54:03
Target

00:53:54:03 - 00:53:54:12
is a

00:53:54:12 - 00:53:54:27
relic

00:53:54:27 - 00:53:54:59
shield.

00:53:55:15 - 00:53:55:35
Watch him

00:53:55:35 - 00:53:55:47
just

00:53:55:55 - 00:53:56:18
whenever

00:53:56:18 - 00:53:56:29
he's

00:53:56:29 - 00:53:56:47
slow

00:53:56:47 - 00:53:57:06
pushing,

00:53:57:06 - 00:53:57:30
come

00:53:57:30 - 00:53:57:48
and

00:53:58:39 - 00:53:58:49
he's

00:53:58:49 - 00:53:59:00
going.

00:53:59:00 - 00:53:59:15
But

00:53:59:29 - 00:54:00:10
I think

00:54:00:10 - 00:54:00:34
what

00:54:00:34 - 00:54:00:54
Tariq

00:54:00:54 - 00:54:01:12
was is

00:54:01:12 - 00:54:01:49
the AP.

00:54:01:49 - 00:54:02:15
I think,

00:54:02:15 - 00:54:02:25
but

00:54:02:25 - 00:54:02:47
that's

00:54:02:47 - 00:54:03:23
the one

00:54:03:23 - 00:54:03:39
that I

00:54:03:39 - 00:54:03:55
think

00:54:03:55 - 00:54:04:04
it

00:54:04:04 - 00:54:05:09
upgrades.

00:54:05:12 - 00:54:05:33
I think

00:54:05:33 - 00:54:05:43
it's

00:54:05:43 - 00:54:05:57
called

00:54:05:57 - 00:54:06:14
Relic

00:54:06:14 - 00:54:06:28
Shield.

00:54:06:28 - 00:54:06:36
At

00:54:06:36 - 00:54:07:08
first

00:54:07:08 - 00:54:07:39
I was

00:54:07:39 - 00:54:07:46
like,

00:54:07:46 - 00:54:08:00
Oh,

00:54:08:00 - 00:54:08:13
it's

00:54:08:13 - 00:54:08:30
called

00:54:08:54 - 00:54:09:27
Buckler

00:54:09:27 - 00:54:09:50
Shield

00:54:09:50 - 00:54:09:59
or

00:54:09:59 - 00:54:10:17
something.

00:54:10:17 - 00:54:10:21
You

00:54:10:21 - 00:54:10:35
know,

00:54:10:35 - 00:54:10:58
Relic

00:54:10:58 - 00:54:11:20
Shield

00:54:11:20 - 00:54:11:31
I

00:54:11:31 - 00:54:11:34
A

00:54:11:34 - 00:54:11:51
Relic

00:54:11:51 - 00:54:12:05
Shield.

00:54:12:05 - 00:54:12:39
The AP

00:54:12:39 - 00:54:12:57
Relic

00:54:12:57 - 00:54:13:12
Shield.

00:54:13:12 - 00:54:14:25
AP Oh,

00:54:14:25 - 00:54:14:51
okay.

00:54:14:51 - 00:54:15:01
I

00:54:15:01 - 00:54:15:25
don't know.

00:54:15:25 - 00:54:15:43
I don't

00:54:15:43 - 00:54:15:52
know

00:54:15:52 - 00:54:16:17
the names

00:54:16:17 - 00:54:16:57
on us.

00:54:16:57 - 00:54:17:04
I'll

00:54:17:04 - 00:54:17:16
just

00:54:17:16 - 00:54:17:45
clarify

00:54:17:45 - 00:54:17:54
that.

00:54:17:54 - 00:54:18:30
I think

00:54:18:32 - 00:54:18:50
I just

00:54:18:50 - 00:54:19:01
played

00:54:19:01 - 00:54:19:39
the game.

00:54:19:39 - 00:54:20:00
I didn't

00:54:20:00 - 00:54:20:29
go

00:54:20:33 - 00:54:21:01
through.

00:54:21:07 - 00:54:22:37
Your code

00:54:22:37 - 00:54:23:07
denies

00:54:23:07 - 00:54:23:15
me

00:54:23:15 - 00:54:23:40
escape

00:54:23:40 - 00:54:23:56
and

00:54:23:56 - 00:54:24:36
shit.

00:54:24:36 - 00:54:24:52
Yeah,

00:54:24:52 - 00:54:25:12
but

00:54:25:12 - 00:54:26:02
I'm in

00:54:26:18 - 00:54:26:51
the attic.

00:54:26:51 - 00:54:27:46
I was doing

00:54:27:46 - 00:54:27:59
this

00:54:27:59 - 00:54:28:37
earlier

00:54:29:09 - 00:54:29:38
and I

00:54:29:38 - 00:54:29:51
like

00:54:29:51 - 00:54:29:58
on

00:54:29:58 - 00:54:30:25
Savannah,

00:54:30:25 - 00:54:30:52
especially

00:54:30:52 - 00:54:31:06
when I

00:54:31:06 - 00:54:31:35
remember

00:54:31:35 - 00:54:31:44
the

00:54:31:44 - 00:54:32:42
specific.

00:54:32:42 - 00:54:32:55
Mm

00:54:32:55 - 00:54:33:19
hmm.

00:54:33:19 - 00:54:33:36
I

00:54:33:36 - 00:54:33:48
gotta

00:54:33:48 - 00:54:33:52
go,

00:54:33:59 - 00:54:34:10
like,

00:54:34:10 - 00:54:34:19
toll

00:54:34:19 - 00:54:34:30
free

00:54:34:30 - 00:54:34:53
items.

00:54:34:53 - 00:54:34:58
And

00:54:34:58 - 00:54:35:09
then

00:54:35:09 - 00:54:35:15
he

00:54:35:15 - 00:54:35:36
just

00:54:35:36 - 00:54:35:49
would

00:54:35:49 - 00:54:36:05
just

00:54:36:05 - 00:54:36:25
place

00:54:36:25 - 00:54:36:40
both

00:54:36:40 - 00:54:36:59
before

00:54:36:59 - 00:54:37:44
the other one

00:54:37:44 - 00:54:37:51
and

00:54:37:51 - 00:54:38:04
just

00:54:38:04 - 00:54:38:15
go

00:54:38:15 - 00:54:38:51
from.

00:54:38:51 - 00:54:39:11
Is it

00:54:39:11 - 00:54:39:57
Shivan

00:54:39:58 - 00:54:40:13
even?

00:54:40:13 - 00:54:40:22
No,

00:54:41:31 - 00:54:41:42
I

00:54:41:42 - 00:54:41:51
don't

00:54:41:51 - 00:54:42:05
know.

00:54:42:05 - 00:54:42:16
I'm

00:54:42:16 - 00:54:42:37
Polish,

00:54:42:37 - 00:54:43:08
so my

00:54:43:08 - 00:54:43:44
pronouncing

00:54:43:44 - 00:54:43:53
might

00:54:43:53 - 00:54:44:02
be,

00:54:44:02 - 00:54:44:42
but

00:54:45:07 - 00:54:45:33
I mean

00:54:46:03 - 00:54:46:36
what

00:54:46:37 - 00:54:46:44

00:54:46:44 - 00:54:47:02
pick

00:54:47:07 - 00:54:47:34
Shivani

00:54:47:34 - 00:54:47:43
or

00:54:47:43 - 00:54:48:43
Shobana?

00:54:48:43 - 00:54:49:39
Shabana

00:54:49:39 - 00:54:50:15
I don't know

00:54:50:15 - 00:54:50:54
what

00:54:51:41 - 00:54:52:22
Shabana

00:54:52:22 - 00:54:52:31
is

00:54:52:31 - 00:54:52:42
in it

00:54:52:42 - 00:54:52:57
based

00:54:52:57 - 00:54:53:13
off of

00:54:53:13 - 00:54:54:07
Shiva.

00:54:54:18 - 00:54:54:37
Almost

00:54:54:37 - 00:54:54:59
typical

00:54:54:59 - 00:54:55:39
to out.

00:54:55:39 - 00:54:55:49
But

00:54:55:49 - 00:54:56:07
it's

00:54:56:15 - 00:54:56:25
she

00:54:56:25 - 00:54:56:40
looks

00:54:56:40 - 00:54:56:54
like

00:54:56:54 - 00:54:57:27
she's

00:54:57:51 - 00:54:58:22
the

00:54:58:22 - 00:54:58:42
God.

Polish.

00:54:59:31 - 00:55:00:12
Sorry.

00:55:00:12 - 00:55:00:36
What does that

00:55:00:36 - 00:55:01:08
mean

00:55:01:17 - 00:55:01:28
on the

00:55:01:28 - 00:55:02:29
backside

00:55:02:35 - 00:55:02:49
there?

00:55:02:49 - 00:55:03:21
Okay,

00:55:03:52 - 00:55:04:19
that's

00:55:04:35 - 00:55:04:53
for

00:55:05:04 - 00:55:05:22
hanging

00:55:05:22 - 00:55:05:40
like

00:55:05:40 - 00:55:06:01
on.

00:55:08:51 - 00:55:09:03
Shiv

00:55:09:03 - 00:55:09:10
is

00:55:09:10 - 00:55:09:19
from

00:55:09:19 - 00:55:09:48
India

00:55:09:48 - 00:55:10:28
right

00:55:10:57 - 00:55:11:40
now.

00:55:12:01 - 00:55:12:12
But

00:55:12:12 - 00:55:13:14
Shiv.

00:55:13:19 - 00:55:13:33
Oh,

00:55:13:33 - 00:55:13:49
my

00:55:13:49 - 00:55:14:07
God.

00:55:14:07 - 00:55:14:27
Although

00:55:14:27 - 00:55:14:51
I'd

00:55:14:51 - 00:55:15:12
also

00:55:15:12 - 00:55:15:27
say

00:55:15:27 - 00:55:15:34

00:55:15:34 - 00:55:15:46

Like

00:55:16:21 - 00:55:16:37

00:55:16:37 - 00:55:16:55
How

00:55:16:55 - 00:55:17:34

00:55:17:34 - 00:55:18:21
Okay.

Oh,

00:55:21:03 - 00:55:21:12
yeah.

00:55:21:19 - 00:55:22:04
What about

00:55:24:16 - 00:55:25:48

00:55:25:48 - 00:55:26:00
It's

00:55:26:00 - 00:55:26:25
shocking,

00:55:26:25 - 00:55:26:36
but

00:55:26:36 - 00:55:27:19

00:58:52:39 - 00:58:52:57
That'll

00:58:52:57 - 00:58:53:15
make a

00:58:53:15 - 00:58:53:47
reference

00:58:53:47 - 00:58:53:55
to

00:58:53:55 - 00:58:54:30
a streamer.

00:58:54:30 - 00:58:54:39
But

00:58:54:39 - 00:58:54:46
I'm

00:58:54:46 - 00:58:54:57
not

00:58:54:57 - 00:58:55:12
going to

00:58:55:12 - 00:58:55:31
do it

00:58:55:31 - 00:58:55:42
because

00:58:55:42 - 00:58:55:51
it's

00:58:55:51 - 00:58:56:02
too

00:58:56:02 - 00:58:56:45
mean.

00:58:57:03 - 00:58:57:57
I

00:58:57:57 - 00:58:58:37

00:59:04:27 - 00:59:04:49
Oh no,

00:59:07:53 - 00:59:08:43
Okay.

00:59:08:51 - 00:59:09:07
But

00:59:09:07 - 00:59:09:36
was it

00:59:09:36 - 00:59:09:52
all

00:59:09:52 - 00:59:10:03
that

00:59:10:03 - 00:59:10:15
like

00:59:10:15 - 00:59:10:30
that

00:59:10:30 - 00:59:10:53

00:59:10:53 - 00:59:11:28
my butt?

00:59:11:28 - 00:59:11:36
I

00:59:11:36 - 00:59:11:45
don't

00:59:11:45 - 00:59:12:16
know.

00:59:12:18 - 00:59:12:28
That

00:59:12:28 - 00:59:12:36
was

00:59:12:36 - 00:59:12:52
actually

00:59:12:52 - 00:59:13:03
pretty

00:59:13:03 - 00:59:13:12
good.

00:59:13:12 - 00:59:13:19
That

00:59:13:19 - 00:59:13:26
was

00:59:13:26 - 00:59:13:39
pretty

00:59:13:39 - 00:59:14:04
good.

00:59:14:31 - 00:59:15:03
Well,

00:59:15:07 - 00:59:15:18
if

00:59:15:18 - 00:59:15:48
the boots

00:59:15:48 - 00:59:15:55
were

00:59:15:55 - 00:59:16:19
facing

00:59:16:19 - 00:59:16:40
the other

00:59:16:40 - 00:59:16:49
way,

00:59:16:49 - 00:59:17:00
I would

00:59:17:00 - 00:59:17:47
have got it.

00:59:18:09 - 00:59:18:52
Oh

00:59:18:52 - 00:59:19:17
Okay.

00:59:19:17 - 00:59:19:37
Okay.

00:59:19:37 - 00:59:20:04
Well,

00:59:20:04 - 00:59:20:13
I

00:59:20:13 - 00:59:21:09
think about it.

00:59:21:09 - 00:59:21:32
I

00:59:21:32 - 00:59:22:03
think.

00:59:22:03 - 00:59:22:12
I

00:59:22:12 - 00:59:22:43
think.

00:59:22:43 - 00:59:23:13
I

00:59:24:07 - 00:59:24:33
think

00:59:25:04 - 00:59:25:14
it's

00:59:25:14 - 00:59:25:58
this.

00:59:27:29 - 00:59:28:20
Oh.

00:59:28:20 - 00:59:29:10
Oh,

00:59:29:54 - 00:59:30:07
God.

00:59:30:07 - 00:59:31:46
It was

00:59:31:46 - 00:59:31:55
a

00:59:31:55 - 00:59:33:10
sofa.

00:59:34:44 - 00:59:35:07
Well,

00:59:35:07 - 00:59:35:25
what?

00:59:39:03 - 00:59:39:16
I.

00:59:39:16 - 00:59:39:36
Hell,

00:59:39:36 - 00:59:40:22
no.

00:59:42:30 - 00:59:43:09
Oh,

00:59:43:19 - 00:59:43:38
God.

00:59:44:38 - 00:59:44:51
It's

00:59:44:51 - 00:59:45:14
good.

00:59:45:14 - 00:59:45:28
That's

00:59:45:28 - 00:59:45:45
good.

00:59:45:45 - 00:59:45:54
That's

00:59:45:54 - 00:59:46:12
good.

00:59:46:12 - 00:59:46:39
Okay.

00:59:46:39 - 00:59:47:04
Okay,

00:59:47:04 - 00:59:47:35
Here

00:59:48:16 - 00:59:48:49

00:59:49:30 - 00:59:50:16
Okay.

00:59:50:24 - 00:59:51:32
Oh, my

00:59:51:32 - 00:59:52:21
Lord.

00:59:52:21 - 00:59:53:29
Okay.

01:00:12:24 - 01:00:12:55
I

01:00:12:55 - 01:00:13:10
don't

01:00:13:10 - 01:00:13:24

All of

01:00:22:19 - 01:00:22:48
this

01:00:22:48 - 01:00:23:24
was

01:00:23:24 - 01:00:24:18
okay.

01:00:25:21 - 01:00:25:31
Oh,

01:00:25:31 - 01:00:25:46

01:00:28:40 - 01:00:29:09
picture

01:00:29:09 - 01:00:29:42
itself

01:00:29:42 - 01:00:29:58
or

01:00:29:58 - 01:00:30:22
anything

01:00:30:22 - 01:00:30:31
that

01:00:30:36 - 01:00:31:04
relates

01:00:31:04 - 01:00:31:22
to it.

Yeah.

God.

I know

01:00:45:03 - 01:00:45:21
it has

01:00:45:21 - 01:00:45:54
to be

01:00:46:08 - 01:00:46:50
okay,

01:00:47:06 - 01:00:47:27
but.

01:00:47:42 - 01:00:48:04
Okay.

01:00:48:04 - 01:00:48:27
Okay.

01:00:48:27 - 01:00:49:03
Another.

01:00:49:03 - 01:00:49:55
Another

01:00:49:55 - 01:00:50:51
invention.

01:00:50:51 - 01:00:51:23
Holy.

01:00:51:23 - 01:00:51:46
Well,

01:00:51:46 - 01:00:51:57
okay,

01:00:51:57 - 01:00:52:10
okay,

01:00:52:10 - 01:00:52:35
okay,

01:00:52:44 - 01:00:53:31
okay.

01:00:55:39 - 01:00:56:09
Oh,

01:00:56:09 - 01:00:56:34
my

01:00:56:34 - 01:00:57:14
God.

01:00:57:14 - 01:00:57:32
What?

01:00:57:32 - 01:00:58:44
This is.

01:00:58:44 - 01:00:59:18
I

01:00:59:18 - 01:00:59:38
never.

01:00:59:38 - 01:01:00:21
I

01:01:00:21 - 01:01:00:37
never

01:01:00:37 - 01:01:00:50
knew

01:01:00:50 - 01:01:00:57
it

01:01:00:57 - 01:01:01:28
looks like

01:01:01:28 - 01:01:01:39
this,

01:01:01:39 - 01:01:01:49
by

01:01:01:49 - 01:01:01:55
the

01:01:01:55 - 01:01:02:02
way.

01:01:02:02 - 01:01:02:07
And

01:01:02:07 - 01:01:02:40
again,

01:01:02:40 - 01:01:02:58
what

01:01:02:58 - 01:01:04:03
the fuck?

01:01:04:49 - 01:01:05:33
Oh,

01:01:05:33 - 01:01:06:00
what

01:01:06:00 - 01:01:07:30
the hell is this?

01:01:07:30 - 01:01:07:53
Where

01:01:07:53 - 01:01:08:02
I.

01:01:08:02 - 01:01:08:22
Give me

01:01:08:22 - 01:01:09:27
a second.

01:01:09:30 - 01:01:09:48
Let

01:01:09:48 - 01:01:10:26
the Picasso

01:01:10:26 - 01:01:10:46
work

01:01:10:46 - 01:01:11:43
at the

01:01:11:45 - 01:01:12:32
bank.

01:01:12:48 - 01:01:13:22
Okay,

01:01:13:22 - 01:01:13:35
now

01:01:13:35 - 01:01:13:54
we get

01:01:13:54 - 01:01:13:58
the

01:01:13:58 - 01:01:14:45
red.

01:01:14:45 - 01:01:15:00
Now I

01:01:15:00 - 01:01:15:10

01:01:15:10 - 01:01:15:39
the

01:01:15:40 - 01:01:16:13
thing.

01:01:17:58 - 01:01:19:45
Oh.

01:01:23:36 - 01:01:23:47
Oh,

01:01:23:47 - 01:01:24:00
I'm

01:01:24:00 - 01:01:24:23
just.

01:01:24:23 - 01:01:24:43
I'm

01:01:24:43 - 01:01:24:55
just

01:01:24:55 - 01:01:25:13
doing

01:01:25:13 - 01:01:25:37
the thing

01:01:25:37 - 01:01:26:04
cause

01:01:26:04 - 01:01:26:18
I

01:01:26:18 - 01:01:26:29
don't

01:01:26:29 - 01:01:26:52
fucking

01:01:26:52 - 01:01:27:21
know

01:01:30:48 - 01:01:31:35
where.

01:01:32:45 - 01:01:32:58
I'll

01:01:32:58 - 01:01:33:12
just

01:01:33:12 - 01:01:33:22
do

01:01:33:22 - 01:01:34:04
this

01:01:34:04 - 01:01:34:40
and.

01:01:34:40 - 01:01:35:20
Oh, I

01:01:35:20 - 01:01:35:47
kind of

01:01:35:47 - 01:01:36:05
fucked

01:01:36:05 - 01:01:36:45
it up.

01:01:37:57 - 01:01:38:13
It's a

01:01:38:13 - 01:01:39:03
topline,

01:01:39:05 - 01:01:39:52
right?

01:01:40:22 - 01:01:40:42
Uh,

01:01:40:44 - 01:01:40:57
no,

01:01:40:57 - 01:01:41:06
no,

01:01:41:06 - 01:01:41:16
no.

01:01:41:16 - 01:01:41:43
Can I see

01:01:41:43 - 01:01:41:54
what

01:01:41:54 - 01:01:42:24
it is?

01:01:42:24 - 01:01:42:50
No.

01:01:42:50 - 01:01:43:22
You can't

01:01:43:22 - 01:01:44:06
get

01:01:44:33 - 01:01:44:43
more

01:01:44:43 - 01:01:45:16
like

01:01:45:37 - 01:01:45:59
if

01:01:45:59 - 01:01:46:30
start

01:01:46:30 - 01:01:46:37
or

01:01:46:37 - 01:01:47:07
something.

01:01:47:07 - 01:01:47:27
I don't

01:01:47:27 - 01:01:48:03
know.

01:01:48:03 - 01:01:48:16
It's

01:01:48:16 - 01:01:48:34
a bit

01:01:48:34 - 01:01:49:06
rough.

01:01:51:09 - 01:01:51:55
Okay,

01:01:52:17 - 01:01:52:46
But

01:01:53:06 - 01:01:53:24
to be

01:01:53:24 - 01:01:53:56
completely

01:01:53:56 - 01:01:54:16
honest,

01:01:54:16 - 01:01:54:41
I've never

01:01:54:41 - 01:01:54:55
seen

01:01:54:55 - 01:01:55:12
how it

01:01:55:12 - 01:01:55:46
works,

01:01:55:46 - 01:01:55:58
How

01:01:55:58 - 01:01:56:33
it looks

01:01:56:33 - 01:01:56:49
to be

01:01:56:49 - 01:01:56:59
a

01:01:57:10 - 01:01:57:23
it

01:01:57:23 - 01:01:57:46
has to be

01:01:57:46 - 01:01:58:48
a champ.

01:01:59:25 - 01:01:59:47
No,

01:01:59:47 - 01:02:00:12
it can be

01:02:00:12 - 01:02:00:45
anything,

01:02:00:45 - 01:02:01:22
right?

01:02:01:22 - 01:02:02:06
This has to be

01:02:02:06 - 01:02:02:22
this.

01:02:02:22 - 01:02:02:33
What's

01:02:02:33 - 01:02:02:52
your vote?

01:02:02:52 - 01:02:03:23
It has to

01:02:03:23 - 01:02:03:33
be.

01:02:03:33 - 01:02:04:01
Oh,

01:02:04:01 - 01:02:04:19
wait,

01:02:04:19 - 01:02:04:33
maybe

01:02:04:33 - 01:02:05:11
this.

01:02:05:11 - 01:02:05:31
Oh,

01:02:05:31 - 01:02:05:47
my

01:02:05:47 - 01:02:07:10
God.

01:02:07:10 - 01:02:07:24
Did

01:02:07:24 - 01:02:07:40
I have

01:02:07:40 - 01:02:07:53
no

01:02:07:53 - 01:02:08:11
idea.

01:02:08:11 - 01:02:08:35
Really.

01:02:08:35 - 01:02:09:03
This one

01:02:09:03 - 01:02:09:12
is

01:02:09:12 - 01:02:09:45
really about.

01:02:09:45 - 01:02:09:55
I'm

01:02:09:55 - 01:02:10:21
sorry.

01:02:10:21 - 01:02:10:59
Okay.

01:02:11:12 - 01:02:11:52
All right.

01:02:11:52 - 01:02:12:55
All of

01:02:12:55 - 01:02:13:29
the

01:02:13:37 - 01:02:13:57
like

01:02:13:57 - 01:02:14:13
it's

01:02:14:13 - 01:02:16:07
the 88.

01:02:16:07 - 01:02:16:21
Oh,

01:02:16:21 - 01:02:16:35
my

01:02:16:35 - 01:02:17:09
God.

01:02:17:09 - 01:02:17:20
Yeah,

01:02:17:20 - 01:02:17:37
that's

01:02:17:37 - 01:02:17:58
hard.

01:02:17:58 - 01:02:18:11
That's

01:02:18:11 - 01:02:18:37
really

01:02:18:37 - 01:02:19:12
hard.

01:02:19:12 - 01:02:19:26
Oh,

01:02:19:26 - 01:02:19:37
my

01:02:19:37 - 01:02:19:57
God.

01:02:19:57 - 01:02:20:02
And

01:02:20:02 - 01:02:20:22
I saw

01:02:20:22 - 01:02:20:29
that

01:02:20:29 - 01:02:20:52
picture,

01:02:20:52 - 01:02:21:05
and I

01:02:21:05 - 01:02:21:21
was like,

01:02:21:21 - 01:02:21:36
What

01:02:21:36 - 01:02:21:46
the

01:02:21:46 - 01:02:22:30

01:02:22:30 - 01:02:22:49
Yeah,

01:02:22:49 - 01:02:23:06
See

01:02:23:06 - 01:02:23:16

01:02:25:46 - 01:02:26:03
Oh,

01:02:30:14 - 01:02:31:26
Okay.

01:02:41:15 - 01:02:41:51
Oh,

01:02:41:51 - 01:02:42:21

01:02:42:21 - 01:02:42:51
Maybe

01:02:42:59 - 01:02:43:13
this

01:02:43:13 - 01:02:43:42
was

01:02:43:42 - 01:02:44:11
the

01:02:44:11 - 01:02:44:58
best.

01:02:45:00 - 01:02:45:46
Fuck.

01:02:45:46 - 01:02:46:06

01:03:11:03 - 01:03:11:09
how

01:03:11:09 - 01:03:11:22

Oh,

01:03:39:54 - 01:03:40:04
so

01:03:40:04 - 01:03:40:48
disgusting.

01:03:40:48 - 01:03:41:18
No,

there's

01:03:41:34 - 01:03:41:43

way to

01:03:42:01 - 01:03:42:09
be

01:03:42:09 - 01:03:42:30
sniping

01:03:42:30 - 01:03:42:45

Oh,

Oh,

God,

01:03:44:54 - 01:03:45:07
No,

01:03:45:07 - 01:03:45:10
you

01:03:45:10 - 01:03:45:25
didn't

01:03:45:25 - 01:03:45:30
have.

01:03:45:30 - 01:03:45:40
I have.

01:03:45:40 - 01:03:45:55
No,

01:03:45:55 - 01:03:46:13
you

01:03:46:13 - 01:03:46:28
didn't

01:03:46:28 - 01:03:46:39
write

01:03:46:39 - 01:03:46:46
it

01:03:46:46 - 01:03:47:46
correctly.

01:03:47:58 - 01:03:48:28
I didn't know

01:03:48:28 - 01:03:50:15
the whole thing.

01:03:50:15 - 01:03:50:54
Okay,

01:03:50:54 - 01:03:51:05
so

Right.

01:03:51:59 - 01:03:52:30
Corrective

01:03:52:30 - 01:03:53:15
clock.

Oh,

It's

01:03:54:46 - 01:03:55:13
okay.

It's

01:03:56:04 - 01:03:56:30
Okay.

01:04:18:07 - 01:04:18:21

Don't

01:04:22:46 - 01:04:22:57

Oh,

Okay.

I thought

01:04:33:59 - 01:04:34:06
you were

01:04:34:06 - 01:04:34:21

01:04:34:21 - 01:04:34:40
something

01:04:34:40 - 01:04:34:58
bad.

01:04:34:58 - 01:04:35:38
Nick

01:04:37:57 - 01:04:38:36
Okay,

Oh,

my

01:05:08:22 - 01:05:08:43

That's

01:05:08:54 - 01:05:09:19

01:05:09:19 - 01:05:09:45
anything

01:05:22:09 - 01:05:22:23
about

01:05:22:23 - 01:05:23:37
correctly.

01:05:23:48 - 01:05:24:52
Oh,

01:05:24:52 - 01:05:25:06
that's

01:05:25:06 - 01:05:25:26
actually

01:05:25:26 - 01:05:25:39
really

01:05:25:39 - 01:05:26:22
good.

01:05:26:25 - 01:05:26:55
Okay,

01:05:26:55 - 01:05:27:18
You.

01:05:27:59 - 01:05:28:17
What is

01:05:28:17 - 01:05:28:28
this?

01:05:28:28 - 01:05:28:53
Exit

01:05:28:53 - 01:05:29:34
The bottom.

01:05:29:34 - 01:05:29:52
That's

01:05:29:52 - 01:05:30:03
where

01:05:30:03 - 01:05:30:10
it's

01:05:30:10 - 01:05:30:41

01:05:31:30 - 01:05:32:24
tree.

01:05:32:27 - 01:05:33:12
Oh,

01:05:33:12 - 01:05:33:28
my

01:05:33:28 - 01:05:34:03
God.

01:05:34:03 - 01:05:34:19
It's

01:05:34:19 - 01:05:34:39
fine,

01:05:34:39 - 01:05:34:51
dude.

01:05:34:51 - 01:05:35:00
It's

01:05:35:00 - 01:05:35:18
fine.

01:05:35:18 - 01:05:35:31
Okay,

01:05:35:31 - 01:05:35:35
I'll

01:05:35:35 - 01:05:35:58
go.

01:05:36:07 - 01:05:36:37
But,

01:05:36:37 - 01:05:37:31
uh.

01:05:37:31 - 01:05:37:57
Okay.

01:05:43:10 - 01:05:43:42
What?

01:05:44:42 - 01:05:44:52

Can

two

01:05:49:13 - 01:05:49:48
slides?

01:05:49:48 - 01:05:49:55
You

01:05:49:55 - 01:05:50:06
could

01:05:50:06 - 01:05:50:24
play

01:05:50:24 - 01:05:50:34

Let

01:05:57:23 - 01:05:57:43
Oh,

01:05:57:43 - 01:05:58:04
said

01:05:58:04 - 01:05:58:12
it

01:05:58:12 - 01:05:58:26
looks

01:05:58:26 - 01:05:58:46
kind

01:05:58:46 - 01:05:58:59
of

01:05:59:22 - 01:05:59:58
square.

01:06:01:48 - 01:06:02:09
What

01:06:02:09 - 01:06:02:25
could

01:06:02:25 - 01:06:03:01
work?

01:06:04:04 - 01:06:04:31
What?

01:06:04:31 - 01:06:04:58
It's

01:06:04:58 - 01:06:05:26
like,

01:06:06:45 - 01:06:07:48
Oh.

Uh

oh.

01:06:17:42 - 01:06:18:00
Oh.

01:06:18:00 - 01:06:18:48
It will be

01:06:18:48 - 01:06:19:19
too much.

01:06:19:19 - 01:06:19:53
This will be

01:06:19:53 - 01:06:20:04
too

01:06:20:04 - 01:06:20:43
much.

01:06:21:13 - 01:06:21:38
And

01:06:21:40 - 01:06:22:10
though.

01:06:22:10 - 01:06:22:33
Okay.

01:06:22:33 - 01:06:23:13
Oh,

01:06:23:13 - 01:06:24:09
my.

01:06:24:09 - 01:06:25:03
Okay.

01:06:25:28 - 01:06:25:42
I'm

01:06:25:42 - 01:06:26:00
still

01:06:26:00 - 01:06:26:22
like,

01:06:26:27 - 01:06:26:45
Come

01:06:26:45 - 01:06:26:56
on.

01:06:26:56 - 01:06:27:03
You're

01:06:27:03 - 01:06:27:32
like,

01:06:27:59 - 01:06:28:26
Yeah,

01:06:28:26 - 01:06:29:04
I know,

01:06:29:04 - 01:06:29:40
but

01:06:29:42 - 01:06:29:58
I'm

01:06:29:58 - 01:06:30:09
with

01:06:30:09 - 01:06:30:38
20

01:06:30:38 - 01:06:31:08
seconds.

01:06:31:08 - 01:06:31:16
You

01:06:31:16 - 01:06:31:42
got 28

01:06:31:42 - 01:06:32:02
seconds

01:06:32:02 - 01:06:32:08
for

01:06:32:08 - 01:06:32:13
me.

01:06:32:13 - 01:06:33:14
You got this.

01:06:34:01 - 01:06:34:16
But

01:06:34:16 - 01:06:34:31
I don't

01:06:34:31 - 01:06:34:40
want

01:06:34:40 - 01:06:34:58
to do

01:06:34:58 - 01:06:35:18
this.

01:06:35:18 - 01:06:35:33
This

01:06:35:33 - 01:06:36:28
will be too.

01:06:36:28 - 01:06:36:39
I

01:06:36:39 - 01:06:36:57
can't

01:06:36:57 - 01:06:37:08
just

01:06:37:08 - 01:06:37:25
do it.

01:06:37:25 - 01:06:37:34
They

01:06:37:34 - 01:06:37:59
don't

01:06:38:09 - 01:06:38:47
do it.

01:06:38:47 - 01:06:39:10
Do it.

01:06:39:10 - 01:06:39:27
Okay.

01:06:39:27 - 01:06:39:55
Okay.

01:06:40:04 - 01:06:40:15
I'll

01:06:40:36 - 01:06:41:07
pass

01:06:41:29 - 01:06:41:40
the

01:06:41:40 - 01:06:41:56
three

01:06:41:56 - 01:06:42:32
fast.

01:06:42:32 - 01:06:42:46
Oh,

01:06:42:46 - 01:06:43:19
but

01:06:43:36 - 01:06:44:24
I entered

01:06:44:24 - 01:06:44:54
the face

01:06:44:54 - 01:06:45:16
already.

01:06:45:16 - 01:06:45:34
Actually,

01:06:45:34 - 01:06:45:50
I know

01:06:45:50 - 01:06:46:18
what

01:06:46:18 - 01:06:46:47
you

01:06:47:33 - 01:06:47:42
do.

01:06:47:42 - 01:06:47:56
Look

01:06:47:56 - 01:06:48:14
at that.

01:06:48:14 - 01:06:48:45
It's

01:06:48:46 - 01:06:49:39
not only the face

01:06:49:39 - 01:06:49:57
here.

01:06:50:38 - 01:06:50:49
No,

01:06:50:49 - 01:06:50:56
no,

01:06:50:56 - 01:06:51:10
no.

01:06:51:10 - 01:06:51:23
It's

01:06:51:23 - 01:06:51:37
like

01:06:51:37 - 01:06:51:50
this

01:06:51:50 - 01:06:52:12
could be

01:06:52:12 - 01:06:52:48
anything,

01:06:52:48 - 01:06:53:31
man.

01:06:53:40 - 01:06:53:56
Yeah,

01:06:53:56 - 01:06:54:27
I know.

01:06:54:27 - 01:06:54:37
I

01:06:54:37 - 01:06:55:08
entered.

01:06:55:08 - 01:06:55:57
I know

01:06:55:57 - 01:06:56:33
what

01:06:56:33 - 01:06:57:15
love

01:06:57:23 - 01:06:57:43
I'm

01:06:57:43 - 01:06:57:57
not

01:06:57:57 - 01:06:58:12
doing

01:06:58:12 - 01:06:58:15
at

01:06:58:15 - 01:06:58:40
this

01:06:59:22 - 01:07:00:15
level,

01:10:57:52 - 01:10:58:03
It

01:10:58:21 - 01:10:58:42
be too

01:10:58:42 - 01:10:59:36
high.

01:10:59:49 - 01:11:00:05
There's

01:11:00:05 - 01:11:00:28
40

01:11:00:28 - 01:11:00:46

01:11:00:46 - 01:11:01:15
at 20

01:11:01:15 - 01:11:02:02
minutes

01:11:02:27 - 01:11:02:42

01:11:02:42 - 01:11:03:03
the gold

01:11:03:03 - 01:11:03:19
score

01:11:03:19 - 01:11:03:27
is

01:11:03:27 - 01:11:03:53
totally

01:11:03:53 - 01:11:04:12
even.

01:11:04:12 - 01:11:04:19
That

01:11:04:19 - 01:11:04:28

01:11:04:28 - 01:11:04:49
not be

01:11:04:49 - 01:11:05:54
possible.

01:11:06:30 - 01:11:06:41

It's

01:12:19:49 - 01:12:21:00
a signature.

01:12:21:00 - 01:12:21:34
All right.

01:12:29:54 - 01:12:30:03
Yeah.

01:12:30:03 - 01:12:30:27
Especially

01:12:30:27 - 01:12:30:37
if you

01:12:30:37 - 01:12:30:46
could

01:12:30:46 - 01:12:31:04
manage

01:12:31:04 - 01:12:31:17
to get

01:12:31:17 - 01:12:31:40
the push

01:12:31:40 - 01:12:32:22

Amazing.

I'm

01:12:55:17 - 01:12:56:29
a little

01:12:56:29 - 01:12:56:49
surprised

01:12:56:49 - 01:12:57:03
to see

01:12:57:03 - 01:12:57:07
the

01:12:57:07 - 01:12:57:28

01:12:57:28 - 01:12:58:14
prioritizing

01:12:58:14 - 01:12:58:35
families,

01:12:58:35 - 01:12:58:46
but

01:12:58:46 - 01:12:59:00
you would

01:12:59:00 - 01:12:59:16
say

01:12:59:16 - 01:12:59:42
already

01:12:59:42 - 01:12:59:56
taken

01:12:59:56 - 01:13:00:01

01:13:00:01 - 01:13:00:30
the table.

01:13:00:30 - 01:13:00:55
But

Okay.

01:13:03:28 - 01:13:04:15
Okay.

01:13:04:15 - 01:13:04:26
And

01:13:04:26 - 01:13:04:44
I like

01:13:04:44 - 01:13:05:11

01:13:05:29 - 01:13:05:38
got

01:13:05:38 - 01:13:06:01
two of

01:13:06:01 - 01:13:06:18
those.

01:13:07:34 - 01:13:07:51
When

01:13:07:51 - 01:13:08:13

01:13:09:14 - 01:13:09:21
they

01:13:09:21 - 01:13:09:37
usually

01:13:09:37 - 01:13:09:47
win

01:13:09:47 - 01:13:09:57
them.

01:13:09:57 - 01:13:10:19
I say,

01:13:10:19 - 01:13:10:37

01:13:14:34 - 01:13:14:52
bonding

01:13:14:52 - 01:13:15:27
not

01:13:15:27 - 01:13:15:32

01:13:15:32 - 01:13:15:55

Take it.

01:13:21:08 - 01:13:21:37
Although

01:13:21:43 - 01:13:21:53
it

01:13:21:53 - 01:13:22:10
picked

01:13:22:10 - 01:13:22:30

01:13:24:37 - 01:13:25:24
Rhodes.

01:13:25:24 - 01:13:25:42
That was

01:13:25:42 - 01:13:25:53
really

01:13:25:53 - 01:13:26:22
good.

01:13:26:45 - 01:13:26:54
That

01:13:26:54 - 01:13:27:08
wasn't.

01:13:27:08 - 01:13:27:16
That

01:13:27:16 - 01:13:27:34
was.

01:13:27:34 - 01:13:27:50
It was

01:13:27:50 - 01:13:29:04

01:13:34:19 - 01:13:34:54
Chad.

01:13:35:04 - 01:13:35:25
I think

01:13:35:25 - 01:13:35:38

01:13:35:38 - 01:13:35:58
coward.

01:13:35:58 - 01:13:36:20

What

01:13:44:11 - 01:13:44:40
we saw

01:13:44:52 - 01:13:45:19
yesterday.

01:13:45:19 - 01:13:45:39
Right.

01:13:45:39 - 01:13:45:43
Were

01:13:45:43 - 01:13:45:55
like,

01:13:45:55 - 01:13:46:22
Hey,

01:13:46:22 - 01:13:46:38
we're going

01:13:46:38 - 01:13:46:46
to

01:13:48:04 - 01:13:48:14
have a

01:13:48:14 - 01:13:48:28
total

01:13:48:28 - 01:13:48:41
long

01:13:48:41 - 01:13:49:15
range

01:13:49:15 - 01:13:49:26
with

01:13:49:26 - 01:13:49:44
a top

01:13:49:44 - 01:13:50:02
later

01:13:50:02 - 01:13:50:27
that

01:13:51:46 - 01:13:52:39
kind of sucks

01:13:52:39 - 01:13:52:44
when

01:13:52:44 - 01:13:52:49
you

01:13:52:49 - 01:13:53:00
get to

01:13:53:00 - 01:13:53:04
the

01:13:53:04 - 01:13:53:15
later

01:13:53:15 - 01:13:53:31
portion

01:13:53:31 - 01:13:53:34
of

01:13:53:34 - 01:13:54:00
the game

01:13:54:00 - 01:13:54:10
on.

01:13:54:10 - 01:13:54:39
Kind

01:13:54:39 - 01:13:54:43
of

01:13:54:43 - 01:13:54:55
is a

01:13:54:55 - 01:13:55:12
great

01:13:55:12 - 01:13:55:30
list

01:13:55:30 - 01:13:56:07
of my flanks.

01:13:56:07 - 01:13:56:33
But

01:13:56:34 - 01:13:57:25
if you only

01:13:57:25 - 01:13:57:37
get

01:13:57:37 - 01:13:58:33
so far

01:13:58:33 - 01:13:58:57
because

01:13:58:57 - 01:13:59:16
you've got

01:13:59:16 - 01:13:59:29
I mean,

01:13:59:29 - 01:13:59:45
I know

01:13:59:45 - 01:13:59:58
which

01:13:59:58 - 01:14:00:19
drive

01:14:00:30 - 01:14:00:39
you

01:14:00:39 - 01:14:01:12
actually,

01:14:01:12 - 01:14:01:37
it's a

01:14:01:37 - 01:14:01:55
it's a

01:14:01:55 - 01:14:02:20
tough one,

01:14:02:20 - 01:14:02:47
I think,

01:14:02:47 - 01:14:03:19
which

01:14:03:19 - 01:14:03:23
you

01:14:03:23 - 01:14:03:32
would

01:14:03:32 - 01:14:03:55
prefer

01:14:03:55 - 01:14:04:04
if

01:14:04:04 - 01:14:04:21
both

01:14:04:21 - 01:14:04:37
teams

01:14:04:37 - 01:14:04:57
are t

01:14:04:57 - 01:14:05:06
one

01:14:05:06 - 01:14:05:31
versus

01:14:05:31 - 01:14:06:21
generally

01:14:06:43 - 01:14:06:58
puts

01:14:06:58 - 01:14:07:12
you on

01:14:07:12 - 01:14:07:36
versus

01:14:07:36 - 01:14:07:51
one.

01:14:07:51 - 01:14:08:04
Yeah.

01:14:08:04 - 01:14:08:11
Which

01:14:08:11 - 01:14:08:24
one do

01:14:08:24 - 01:14:08:58
you think

01:14:08:58 - 01:14:09:19
deal

01:14:09:19 - 01:14:09:32
with

01:14:09:32 - 01:14:09:41

feeling

01:14:13:55 - 01:14:14:02
the

01:14:14:02 - 01:14:14:20
wrath?

01:14:14:20 - 01:14:14:31
I

01:14:14:31 - 01:14:14:54
personally

01:14:14:54 - 01:14:15:40
think

01:14:15:40 - 01:14:15:54
number

01:14:15:54 - 01:14:16:10

Don't

01:14:30:03 - 01:14:30:34

01:14:30:34 - 01:14:31:15
Why?

01:14:31:15 - 01:14:31:28
I'm

01:14:31:28 - 01:14:31:55
curious

01:14:31:55 - 01:14:32:16
if they found

01:14:32:16 - 01:14:32:38
something

01:14:32:40 - 01:14:33:37
because

01:14:33:45 - 01:14:33:54
they

01:14:33:54 - 01:14:34:13
picked

01:14:34:13 - 01:14:34:15

right?

01:14:36:54 - 01:14:37:33
Yeah.

01:14:37:40 - 01:14:37:57
They want

01:14:37:57 - 01:14:38:00
to

01:14:38:00 - 01:14:38:42
stun

01:14:38:42 - 01:14:38:52

01:14:38:52 - 01:14:39:03
kill

01:14:39:03 - 01:14:39:09
the

01:14:39:09 - 01:14:39:41

01:14:39:41 - 01:14:40:10
Cassandra

01:14:40:10 - 01:14:40:17

Yeah.

01:14:43:46 - 01:14:44:39
Resources.

01:14:44:45 - 01:14:45:01
That's

01:14:45:01 - 01:14:45:09
if

01:14:45:09 - 01:14:45:18
they

01:14:45:18 - 01:14:45:36

01:14:45:36 - 01:14:46:10

It is

01:15:21:54 - 01:15:22:28
or

01:15:22:35 - 01:15:22:48

01:15:24:41 - 01:15:24:55
best of

01:15:24:55 - 01:15:25:31
three

01:15:25:31 - 01:15:25:57
get to lock

01:15:25:57 - 01:15:26:06

01:15:26:06 - 01:15:26:18
No

01:15:26:18 - 01:15:26:54
it is

01:15:27:14 - 01:15:27:25
it's

01:15:27:25 - 01:15:27:36
best

01:15:27:36 - 01:15:27:39
of

01:15:27:39 - 01:15:28:08

01:15:29:09 - 01:15:29:42
Okay.

01:15:29:47 - 01:15:30:02
I mean,

01:15:30:02 - 01:15:30:30
the values

01:15:30:30 - 01:15:30:50
would be

01:15:30:50 - 01:15:31:33
the

01:15:31:33 - 01:15:31:46
more

01:15:31:46 - 01:15:32:09
obvious

01:15:32:09 - 01:15:32:18
one

01:15:32:18 - 01:15:32:34
to go

01:15:32:34 - 01:15:32:47
back

01:15:32:47 - 01:15:33:07
towards.

01:15:33:07 - 01:15:33:21
I think

01:15:33:21 - 01:15:33:27
it's

01:15:33:27 - 01:15:33:41
just

01:15:33:41 - 01:15:33:48
they

01:15:33:48 - 01:15:34:03
think

01:15:34:03 - 01:15:34:08

01:15:34:08 - 01:15:34:21

01:15:34:21 - 01:15:34:30

01:15:35:02 - 01:15:35:21
you.

01:15:35:21 - 01:15:36:03
It wasn't

01:15:36:03 - 01:15:36:14
just

01:15:36:14 - 01:15:36:25
when

01:15:36:46 - 01:15:36:52
you

01:15:36:52 - 01:15:37:01
didn't

01:15:37:01 - 01:15:37:13
send me

01:15:37:13 - 01:15:37:33
anything.

01:15:37:33 - 01:15:37:49

Okay.

01:16:02:51 - 01:16:03:01
It's

01:16:03:09 - 01:16:03:28
final

01:16:03:28 - 01:16:03:43
pick

01:16:03:43 - 01:16:03:57
up.

01:16:04:06 - 01:16:04:25
But

01:16:04:25 - 01:16:04:40

01:16:05:22 - 01:16:05:33
Why

Jordan

01:16:06:14 - 01:16:06:41
Poker

01:16:06:41 - 01:16:07:06
already.

01:16:07:06 - 01:16:07:34
Fucking

01:16:07:34 - 01:16:08:27
alliance.

01:16:08:27 - 01:16:08:47
Oh,

01:16:08:47 - 01:16:09:05
my

01:16:09:05 - 01:16:09:23
God.

01:16:09:23 - 01:16:09:39
Okay,

01:16:10:53 - 01:16:11:22
so,

01:16:11:22 - 01:16:11:45
like

01:16:11:52 - 01:16:11:58
an

01:16:11:58 - 01:16:12:45
alliance.

01:16:12:45 - 01:16:13:22
Okay,

01:16:13:22 - 01:16:13:30
They'll

01:16:13:30 - 01:16:13:40
get in

01:16:13:40 - 01:16:13:44
a

01:16:13:44 - 01:16:13:57
couple

01:16:13:57 - 01:16:14:13
of pop

01:16:14:13 - 01:16:14:42
shots.

01:16:14:42 - 01:16:15:03
Okay.

01:16:15:03 - 01:16:15:21
And

01:16:15:21 - 01:16:15:48
after

01:16:15:48 - 01:16:16:09
we get

01:16:16:09 - 01:16:16:22
the

01:16:16:22 - 01:16:17:22
Cali,

01:16:17:22 - 01:16:17:42
the thing

01:16:17:42 - 01:16:17:50
is,

01:16:17:50 - 01:16:18:14
let's

01:16:18:14 - 01:16:19:51
see,

01:16:19:57 - 01:16:20:52
uh,

01:16:20:52 - 01:16:21:10
I mean,

01:16:21:10 - 01:16:21:27
I think

01:16:21:27 - 01:16:21:41
what's

01:16:21:41 - 01:16:22:19
happening,

01:16:22:30 - 01:16:22:46
I mean,

01:16:22:46 - 01:16:22:53
our

01:16:22:53 - 01:16:23:11
seventh

01:16:23:11 - 01:16:23:29
draft

01:16:23:29 - 01:16:23:40
is an

01:16:23:40 - 01:16:23:54
O

01:16:23:54 - 01:16:24:01
or

01:16:24:01 - 01:16:24:18
alien,

01:16:24:18 - 01:16:24:30
so.

01:16:24:30 - 01:16:24:59
Well,

01:16:25:10 - 01:16:25:16
the

01:16:25:16 - 01:16:25:50
AK.

01:16:25:51 - 01:16:26:51
Oh, my

01:16:26:51 - 01:16:27:30
Lord.

01:16:27:30 - 01:16:27:39
Oh,

01:16:27:39 - 01:16:27:59
yeah.

01:16:27:59 - 01:16:28:22
Ah,

01:16:28:22 - 01:16:28:40
really?

01:16:28:40 - 01:16:29:06
And so

01:16:29:06 - 01:16:29:13
at

01:16:29:13 - 01:16:29:34
least

01:16:29:34 - 01:16:29:47
makes

01:16:29:47 - 01:16:30:01
a lot

01:16:30:01 - 01:16:30:05
of

01:16:30:05 - 01:16:30:23
sense,

01:16:30:23 - 01:16:31:17
actually.

01:16:31:19 - 01:16:31:46
Right.

01:16:31:46 - 01:16:32:02
Let's

01:16:32:02 - 01:16:32:15
see

01:16:32:15 - 01:16:32:29
how

01:16:32:29 - 01:16:32:42
much

01:16:32:42 - 01:16:33:14
damage

01:16:33:14 - 01:16:33:55
I think

01:16:33:55 - 01:16:34:08
our

01:16:34:08 - 01:16:34:30
seven

01:16:34:30 - 01:16:35:02
wins.

01:16:35:02 - 01:16:35:20
All right,

01:16:35:20 - 01:16:35:37
Jungle

01:16:35:37 - 01:16:35:40
of

01:16:35:40 - 01:16:36:18
the upside.

01:16:36:18 - 01:16:37:04
What are you

01:16:37:04 - 01:16:37:12
in?

01:16:37:12 - 01:16:38:09
Draft.

01:16:38:15 - 01:16:38:44
Draft?

01:16:38:44 - 01:16:39:15
Yeah.

01:16:39:37 - 01:16:40:13
Oh,

01:16:40:13 - 01:16:40:26
I

01:16:40:26 - 01:16:41:58
think in

01:16:41:58 - 01:16:42:05
if

01:16:42:05 - 01:16:42:23
this was

01:16:42:23 - 01:16:42:41
t one

01:16:42:41 - 01:16:42:54
verse

01:16:42:54 - 01:16:44:16
t one

01:16:44:51 - 01:16:44:58
where

01:16:44:58 - 01:16:45:05
like

01:16:45:05 - 01:16:45:23
Jenji

01:16:45:23 - 01:16:45:34
versus

01:16:45:34 - 01:16:46:03
Jenji.

01:16:46:03 - 01:16:46:15
Yeah.

01:16:46:15 - 01:16:46:30
I mean

01:16:46:30 - 01:16:46:44
I think

01:16:46:44 - 01:16:47:25
our seven wins,

01:16:47:25 - 01:16:47:43
I think

01:16:47:43 - 01:16:48:07
our alien

01:16:48:07 - 01:16:48:19
soul

01:16:48:19 - 01:16:48:36
is so

01:16:48:36 - 01:16:49:26
disgustingly

01:16:49:26 - 01:16:49:49
broken

01:16:49:49 - 01:16:49:55
and

01:16:49:55 - 01:16:50:04
just

01:16:50:04 - 01:16:50:20
no one

01:16:50:20 - 01:16:50:34
plays

01:16:50:34 - 01:16:50:56
them.

01:16:51:14 - 01:16:51:48
I don't know

01:16:51:48 - 01:16:52:03
why

01:16:52:03 - 01:16:52:12
they

01:16:52:12 - 01:16:52:44
overreact

01:16:52:44 - 01:16:52:57
to his

01:16:52:57 - 01:16:53:22
nerves.

01:16:53:22 - 01:16:54:01
Yeah,

01:16:54:01 - 01:16:54:12
there's

01:16:54:12 - 01:16:54:18
a

01:16:54:18 - 01:16:54:34
lot of

01:16:54:34 - 01:16:55:03
scaling

01:16:55:03 - 01:16:55:12
on

01:16:55:12 - 01:16:55:19
this

01:16:55:19 - 01:16:56:06
side.

01:16:56:06 - 01:16:57:00
Not so much

01:16:57:00 - 01:16:57:43
scaling.

01:16:57:46 - 01:16:57:57
Well,

01:16:57:57 - 01:16:58:06
let me

01:16:58:06 - 01:16:58:19
order

01:16:58:19 - 01:16:58:26
my

01:16:58:26 - 01:16:58:37
food,

01:16:58:37 - 01:16:58:44
by

01:16:58:44 - 01:16:58:48
the

01:16:58:48 - 01:16:58:53
way,

01:16:58:53 - 01:16:59:03
real

01:16:59:03 - 01:16:59:34
quick.

01:17:00:10 - 01:17:00:28
So my

01:17:00:28 - 01:17:00:54
phone,

01:17:01:04 - 01:17:01:45
should that be

01:17:02:02 - 01:17:02:18
What do I

01:17:02:18 - 01:17:02:42
order?

01:17:02:42 - 01:17:02:52
I'm

01:17:02:52 - 01:17:03:05
thinking

01:17:03:05 - 01:17:04:10
McDonald's.

01:17:04:28 - 01:17:05:15
She's

01:17:05:15 - 01:17:05:58
good.

01:17:06:19 - 01:17:06:36
But

01:17:06:36 - 01:17:06:55
you never

01:17:06:55 - 01:17:07:06
like

01:17:07:06 - 01:17:07:17
when I

01:17:07:17 - 01:17:07:26
order

01:17:07:26 - 01:17:07:49
McDonald's,

01:17:07:49 - 01:17:08:00
man.

01:17:08:00 - 01:17:08:09
What's

01:17:08:09 - 01:17:08:18
going

01:17:08:18 - 01:17:08:47
on?

01:17:09:07 - 01:17:09:19
Just

01:17:09:19 - 01:17:09:30
get a

01:17:09:30 - 01:17:10:33
pizza.

01:17:10:33 - 01:17:10:51
You can't

01:17:10:51 - 01:17:10:57
get

01:17:10:57 - 01:17:11:16
a pizza.

01:17:11:16 - 01:17:11:22
No,

01:17:11:22 - 01:17:11:34
I'm in

01:17:11:34 - 01:17:12:00
calories.

01:17:12:00 - 01:17:12:54
That is

01:17:13:10 - 01:17:13:22
true.

01:17:13:22 - 01:17:13:43
So,

01:17:13:48 - 01:17:14:09
I mean,

01:17:14:09 - 01:17:14:18
you're

01:17:14:18 - 01:17:14:29

01:17:14:29 - 01:17:14:54
fat.

01:17:14:54 - 01:17:15:27
No,

01:17:16:01 - 01:17:17:04

01:17:18:47 - 01:17:19:43
Okay.

01:17:21:59 - 01:17:22:12
I'm

01:17:22:28 - 01:17:22:33

01:17:22:33 - 01:17:23:02
Yeah.

Weather

when I was

01:17:50:36 - 01:17:50:43
in

01:17:50:43 - 01:17:51:07
America,

01:17:51:07 - 01:17:51:55
I had a triple

01:17:51:55 - 01:17:52:28
cheeseburger

01:17:52:28 - 01:17:52:37
and

01:17:52:37 - 01:17:53:02
that shit

01:17:53:02 - 01:17:53:27
was so

01:17:53:27 - 01:17:53:52
soft.

01:17:53:52 - 01:17:54:21
It was so

01:17:54:21 - 01:17:54:48
good.

01:17:54:48 - 01:17:55:12
Oh, I

01:17:55:12 - 01:17:55:33
know,

01:17:55:33 - 01:17:55:46
man.

01:17:55:46 - 01:17:55:55
It's

01:17:55:55 - 01:17:56:11
so

01:17:56:11 - 01:17:56:43
nice.

01:17:56:43 - 01:17:57:00
It's

01:17:57:00 - 01:17:57:16
so

01:17:57:16 - 01:17:57:57
nice

01:17:57:57 - 01:17:58:04
to

01:17:58:04 - 01:17:58:08
the

01:17:58:08 - 01:17:58:19
Mac.

01:17:58:19 - 01:17:58:41
Just

01:17:58:41 - 01:17:58:44
the

01:17:58:44 - 01:17:59:24
deal.

01:17:59:24 - 01:18:00:03
Yeah.

01:18:00:07 - 01:18:00:43
This time

01:18:00:43 - 01:18:01:01
he's

01:18:01:01 - 01:18:01:17
got

01:18:01:17 - 01:18:02:36
damage.

01:18:03:57 - 01:18:04:37
Mm.

01:18:04:37 - 01:18:05:11
Okay.

01:18:05:11 - 01:18:05:33
I mean,

01:18:05:33 - 01:18:05:45
I think

01:18:05:45 - 01:18:06:10
our seven

01:18:06:10 - 01:18:06:18
is

01:18:06:18 - 01:18:06:28
just

01:18:06:28 - 01:18:06:36
going

01:18:06:36 - 01:18:06:48
to get

01:18:06:48 - 01:18:07:21
completely

01:18:07:21 - 01:18:07:51
stomped

01:18:07:51 - 01:18:08:11
in this

01:18:08:11 - 01:18:08:43
game.

01:18:09:14 - 01:18:09:41
Nothing

01:18:09:41 - 01:18:09:47
that

01:18:09:47 - 01:18:09:52
they're

01:18:09:52 - 01:18:09:59
going

01:18:09:59 - 01:18:10:06
to be

01:18:10:06 - 01:18:10:13
able

01:18:10:13 - 01:18:10:29
to do.

01:18:10:29 - 01:18:10:40
Hope

01:18:10:40 - 01:18:11:24
not.

01:18:11:27 - 01:18:11:33
But

01:18:11:33 - 01:18:11:45
we've

01:18:11:45 - 01:18:11:56
got

01:18:11:56 - 01:18:12:37
big

01:18:12:37 - 01:18:13:10
ideas.

01:18:13:10 - 01:18:13:42
I that

01:18:13:42 - 01:18:14:42
our asshole

01:18:14:42 - 01:18:15:05
actually

01:18:15:05 - 01:18:15:16
win

01:18:15:16 - 01:18:15:21
the

01:18:15:21 - 01:18:15:57
game.

01:18:16:28 - 01:18:18:12
The big fans

01:18:18:12 - 01:18:18:59
I think

01:18:19:04 - 01:18:19:51
think

01:18:19:51 - 01:18:20:37
that

01:18:20:54 - 01:18:21:03
to

01:18:21:03 - 01:18:21:39
celebrate

01:18:21:39 - 01:18:21:54
their

01:18:21:54 - 01:18:22:22
team

01:18:23:34 - 01:18:23:52
also

01:18:23:52 - 01:18:24:18
you go

01:18:24:18 - 01:18:24:34
doesn't

01:18:24:34 - 01:18:24:55
have

01:18:25:06 - 01:18:25:48
to

01:18:25:48 - 01:18:26:16
face

01:18:26:16 - 01:18:26:40
this game

01:18:26:40 - 01:18:26:54
I don't

01:18:26:54 - 01:18:27:05
think

01:18:27:05 - 01:18:27:14
it's

01:18:27:14 - 01:18:27:45
smart

01:18:27:45 - 01:18:28:17
I think

01:18:28:17 - 01:18:28:40
versus

01:18:28:40 - 01:18:28:46
how

01:18:28:46 - 01:18:28:51
we're

01:18:28:51 - 01:18:28:58
going

01:18:28:58 - 01:18:29:02
to

01:18:29:02 - 01:18:29:15
solve

01:18:29:15 - 01:18:29:40
phase

01:18:29:45 - 01:18:30:12
two so

01:18:30:12 - 01:18:30:52
you know

01:18:30:55 - 01:18:31:10
yeah

01:18:31:10 - 01:18:31:31
business

01:18:31:31 - 01:18:31:37
is

01:18:31:37 - 01:18:31:49
really

01:18:31:49 - 01:18:32:15
good

01:18:32:33 - 01:18:32:43
for

01:18:32:43 - 01:18:32:58
doing

01:18:32:58 - 01:18:33:18
the fight

01:18:33:18 - 01:18:33:23
and

01:18:33:23 - 01:18:33:54
getting out.

01:18:33:54 - 01:18:34:37
Yeah,

01:18:35:29 - 01:18:35:43
but

01:18:35:43 - 01:18:36:03
he might

01:18:36:03 - 01:18:36:10
be

01:18:36:10 - 01:18:36:34
thinking

01:18:36:34 - 01:18:36:43
that

01:18:36:43 - 01:18:36:57
he'll

01:18:36:57 - 01:18:37:22
just

01:18:37:22 - 01:18:37:35
get

01:18:37:35 - 01:18:38:02
smirks

01:18:38:02 - 01:18:38:49
early

01:18:38:49 - 01:18:39:06
and

01:18:39:58 - 01:18:40:14
not

01:18:40:14 - 01:18:40:28
die.

01:18:40:28 - 01:18:41:01
Maybe

01:18:41:01 - 01:18:41:25
if they can

01:18:41:25 - 01:18:41:47
try

01:18:41:47 - 01:18:41:52
and

01:18:41:52 - 01:18:42:09
get to

01:18:42:09 - 01:18:42:18

01:18:42:18 - 01:18:42:32

01:18:42:32 - 01:18:42:50
game.

01:18:43:12 - 01:18:43:42

trapped.

I don't

01:18:50:42 - 01:18:51:10

01:18:51:10 - 01:18:51:28
Probably

01:18:51:28 - 01:18:51:34

01:18:51:34 - 01:18:51:45
don't

01:18:51:45 - 01:18:51:51

01:18:51:51 - 01:18:52:31
horrible

01:18:52:31 - 01:18:52:45
way.

01:18:52:45 - 01:18:52:58

01:19:00:53 - 01:19:01:34
line.

01:19:02:13 - 01:19:02:24
It's

Yeah,

01:20:57:21 - 01:20:57:34
let's

01:20:57:34 - 01:20:58:03

01:20:58:03 - 01:20:58:30
Accuse.

01:20:58:30 - 01:20:58:42
Good,

01:20:58:57 - 01:20:59:29
Yeah,

01:21:00:09 - 01:21:01:30

Fine.

01:21:02:22 - 01:21:03:19
All right.

01:21:03:19 - 01:21:04:04
Okay.

01:21:04:04 - 01:21:04:19
I'm

01:21:04:19 - 01:21:04:26
going

01:21:04:30 - 01:21:04:57
live

01:21:04:57 - 01:21:05:06

01:21:05:22 - 01:21:05:47
one.

01:21:05:47 - 01:21:06:05
Okay.

01:21:06:05 - 01:21:06:18
I think

01:21:06:18 - 01:21:06:27
it's

01:21:06:27 - 01:21:07:31
doable,

01:21:07:33 - 01:21:07:48

01:21:07:48 - 01:21:07:57
our

01:21:07:57 - 01:21:08:40
Elizabeth

01:21:08:40 - 01:21:09:11

Great

01:21:09:32 - 01:21:09:48
play,

01:21:09:48 - 01:21:10:21

don't

01:21:10:37 - 01:21:10:48
know,

01:21:10:48 - 01:21:11:15
Brock,

01:21:11:15 - 01:21:12:00
If BLT

01:21:12:00 - 01:21:12:12
did

01:21:12:12 - 01:21:12:25
that,

01:21:12:25 - 01:21:12:52
they would

01:21:12:52 - 01:21:13:01
say

01:21:13:01 - 01:21:13:12
it's

01:21:13:12 - 01:21:13:46
over.

01:21:13:46 - 01:21:14:06
I don't

01:21:14:06 - 01:21:14:18
know.

01:21:14:18 - 01:21:15:05
I don't

01:21:15:05 - 01:21:15:34
know.

01:21:15:48 - 01:21:16:04
I mean,

01:21:16:04 - 01:21:16:40
it would be over

01:21:16:40 - 01:21:16:57
because

01:21:17:13 - 01:21:17:22
the

01:21:17:22 - 01:21:17:47
players

01:21:17:47 - 01:21:17:58

Yeah,

01:21:18:19 - 01:21:18:34

01:21:51:57 - 01:21:52:17
broke.

01:21:52:17 - 01:21:52:26
He

01:21:52:26 - 01:21:52:44
could have

01:21:52:44 - 01:21:52:49
been

01:21:52:49 - 01:21:53:09
trading

01:21:53:09 - 01:21:53:18

and

01:21:57:59 - 01:21:58:06
then

01:21:58:06 - 01:21:58:12
you

01:21:58:12 - 01:21:58:26
run

01:21:58:26 - 01:21:58:51
around

01:21:58:51 - 01:21:59:25
like a real.

01:21:59:25 - 01:21:59:33
And

01:21:59:42 - 01:22:00:01
if you'll

01:22:00:01 - 01:22:00:12
just

01:22:00:12 - 01:22:00:28

01:22:13:51 - 01:22:14:04
It's

01:22:14:04 - 01:22:14:47

01:22:17:42 - 01:22:17:52
he's

01:22:17:52 - 01:22:18:00
the

01:22:18:00 - 01:22:18:28
CEO.

01:22:18:28 - 01:22:18:39
Dude,

01:22:18:39 - 01:22:18:55
leave him

01:22:18:55 - 01:22:19:35
alone.

01:22:19:46 - 01:22:20:09
I mean,

01:22:20:09 - 01:22:20:18
what

01:22:20:18 - 01:22:21:22
the fuck

01:22:21:22 - 01:22:21:37
got up

01:22:21:37 - 01:22:21:43

01:22:21:43 - 01:22:21:52

01:22:21:52 - 01:22:22:49
topside

01:22:22:49 - 01:22:23:22
finally?

01:22:23:22 - 01:22:23:31
I

01:22:23:31 - 01:22:23:42
mean,

01:22:23:42 - 01:22:24:00
it's.

01:22:24:03 - 01:22:24:30
It's

01:22:24:30 - 01:22:24:39
at

01:22:24:39 - 01:22:24:57
this

01:22:24:57 - 01:22:25:23
point,

01:22:25:23 - 01:22:25:33
I'll

01:22:25:33 - 01:22:25:51
be honest.

01:22:25:51 - 01:22:26:07
There was

01:22:26:07 - 01:22:26:25
nothing

01:22:26:25 - 01:22:26:56
he could've

01:22:26:56 - 01:22:27:30
done

01:22:27:30 - 01:22:27:39
for

01:22:27:39 - 01:22:27:55
one

01:22:27:55 - 01:22:28:33
in the back

01:22:28:33 - 01:22:28:57
from the.

01:22:28:57 - 01:22:29:06
Well,

01:22:29:06 - 01:22:29:15
he

01:22:29:15 - 01:22:29:29
steam

01:22:29:29 - 01:22:29:43
just

01:22:29:43 - 01:22:29:54
should

01:22:29:54 - 01:22:30:00
have

01:22:30:00 - 01:22:30:10
been.

01:22:30:10 - 01:22:30:50
But.

01:22:31:06 - 01:22:31:17
But

01:22:31:17 - 01:22:31:37
they also

01:22:31:37 - 01:22:31:53
killed

01:22:31:53 - 01:22:32:33
to get

01:22:32:33 - 01:22:32:51
something

01:22:32:51 - 01:22:33:10
back.

01:22:33:10 - 01:22:33:19
But

01:22:33:19 - 01:22:33:37
or,

01:22:33:48 - 01:22:33:57
but

01:22:33:57 - 01:22:34:21
then

01:22:34:21 - 01:22:35:33
if they don't dive

01:22:35:33 - 01:22:35:40
and

01:22:35:40 - 01:22:35:54
then

01:22:35:54 - 01:22:36:16
jangles

01:22:36:16 - 01:22:36:45
there

01:22:36:52 - 01:22:37:21
then

01:22:37:33 - 01:22:37:44
all

01:22:37:44 - 01:22:37:50
the

01:22:37:50 - 01:22:38:04
gets

01:22:38:04 - 01:22:38:20
fucked.

01:22:38:20 - 01:22:38:33
So

01:22:38:33 - 01:22:38:40
it

01:22:38:40 - 01:22:38:51
does

01:22:38:51 - 01:22:39:16
just

01:22:39:16 - 01:22:39:59
for

01:22:40:08 - 01:22:41:11
to 18

01:22:41:11 - 01:22:41:36
with

01:22:42:01 - 01:22:43:27
Jesus.

01:22:43:27 - 01:22:43:39
Well

01:22:43:39 - 01:22:44:22
already.

01:22:44:22 - 01:22:44:29
Oh

01:22:44:29 - 01:22:44:52
my ears

01:22:44:52 - 01:22:45:03
just

01:22:45:03 - 01:22:45:46
popping

01:22:46:10 - 01:22:47:42
all off

01:22:47:42 - 01:22:48:39
we go.

01:22:48:39 - 01:22:48:50
What

01:22:48:50 - 01:22:49:42
the fuck.

01:22:49:42 - 01:22:50:16
Yeah.

01:22:50:16 - 01:22:50:26
This

01:22:50:26 - 01:22:50:44
record

01:22:50:44 - 01:22:50:55
of

01:22:50:55 - 01:22:51:33
turkey

01:22:51:34 - 01:22:51:54
like

01:22:51:54 - 01:22:52:12
this,

01:22:52:12 - 01:22:52:19
it's

01:22:52:19 - 01:22:52:37
probably

01:22:52:37 - 01:22:53:09
that

01:22:53:16 - 01:22:53:24
it's

01:22:53:24 - 01:22:53:52
not a

01:22:54:11 - 01:22:54:24
lot,

01:22:54:25 - 01:22:54:45
but.

01:22:54:59 - 01:22:55:31
Yeah,

01:22:55:39 - 01:22:55:49
yeah.

01:22:55:49 - 01:22:55:58
No,

01:22:55:58 - 01:22:56:07
no,

01:22:56:07 - 01:22:56:27
I think

01:22:56:27 - 01:22:56:45
I think

01:22:56:45 - 01:22:57:09
ourselves

01:22:57:09 - 01:22:57:23
running

01:22:57:23 - 01:22:57:34
on

01:22:57:34 - 01:22:57:57
double

01:22:57:57 - 01:22:58:13
Ian

01:22:58:13 - 01:22:58:33
record

01:22:58:33 - 01:22:59:13
I think.

01:22:59:13 - 01:22:59:56
Oh

01:22:59:56 - 01:23:00:52
like that.

01:23:00:52 - 01:23:01:08
Yeah

01:23:01:08 - 01:23:01:28
you might

01:23:01:28 - 01:23:01:35
be

01:23:01:35 - 01:23:02:04
right.

01:23:02:43 - 01:23:03:12
I think

01:23:03:12 - 01:23:03:30
that

01:23:03:30 - 01:23:03:45
if,

01:23:03:45 - 01:23:04:06
if,

01:23:04:08 - 01:23:04:21
if

01:23:04:21 - 01:23:04:39
the way

01:23:04:39 - 01:23:04:43
they

01:23:04:43 - 01:23:04:58
looked

01:23:04:58 - 01:23:05:22
at him

01:23:05:22 - 01:23:06:07
smoking

01:23:06:07 - 01:23:06:28
is

01:23:06:28 - 01:23:06:37
dude

01:23:06:37 - 01:23:06:46
is

01:23:06:46 - 01:23:07:19
actually

01:23:07:19 - 01:23:08:06
annihilating

01:23:08:06 - 01:23:09:00
this

01:23:09:01 - 01:23:09:39
legit

01:23:09:39 - 01:23:10:22
dude.

01:23:10:57 - 01:23:11:18
What

01:23:11:18 - 01:23:11:31
the

01:23:11:31 - 01:23:12:12
fuck.

01:23:13:37 - 01:23:13:51
I

01:23:13:51 - 01:23:14:09
think

01:23:14:09 - 01:23:14:20
this

01:23:14:20 - 01:23:14:31
game

01:23:14:31 - 01:23:14:43
might

01:23:14:43 - 01:23:14:49
be

01:23:14:49 - 01:23:15:03
a very

01:23:15:03 - 01:23:15:32
long game

01:23:15:32 - 01:23:16:08
honestly.

01:23:16:08 - 01:23:16:33
Yeah

01:23:16:33 - 01:23:17:06
I think

01:23:17:06 - 01:23:17:15
so

01:23:17:15 - 01:23:17:27
too.

01:23:17:27 - 01:23:17:34
It's

01:23:17:34 - 01:23:18:03
fucked,

01:23:18:03 - 01:23:18:28
but

01:23:18:28 - 01:23:19:04
like a

01:23:19:04 - 01:23:19:17
really

01:23:19:17 - 01:23:19:31
awful

01:23:19:31 - 01:23:19:49

01:23:19:49 - 01:23:20:24
forever.

01:23:20:24 - 01:23:20:45
Yeah.

01:23:20:45 - 01:23:21:28
Yeah.

01:23:21:28 - 01:23:21:34
And

01:23:21:34 - 01:23:22:12
as well.

01:23:22:12 - 01:23:22:19
But

01:23:22:19 - 01:23:22:40
I've seen

01:23:22:40 - 01:23:22:49
he

01:23:22:49 - 01:23:22:58
could

01:23:22:58 - 01:23:23:22
put on

01:23:23:22 - 01:23:23:29
that

01:23:23:29 - 01:23:23:56
performance

01:23:23:56 - 01:23:24:03
now

01:23:24:03 - 01:23:24:12
with the

01:23:24:12 - 01:23:24:32
Iranians

01:23:24:32 - 01:23:25:26
all again.

01:23:25:31 - 01:23:25:42
Oh

01:23:25:42 - 01:23:25:51
it's

01:23:25:51 - 01:23:26:09
going

01:23:26:09 - 01:23:26:20
in

01:23:26:20 - 01:23:27:18
the game

01:23:27:23 - 01:23:28:01
too.

01:23:28:09 - 01:23:28:21
All

01:23:28:21 - 01:23:28:33

01:23:29:24 - 01:23:29:33
Oh,

Oh,

01:23:32:20 - 01:23:33:09
my

01:23:33:09 - 01:23:34:26
God.

01:23:34:26 - 01:23:34:37
He's

01:23:34:37 - 01:23:35:09
sucking

01:23:35:09 - 01:23:35:20
him

01:23:35:20 - 01:23:35:42

01:23:35:47 - 01:23:36:12
Oh,

01:23:36:12 - 01:23:36:37
my

01:23:36:37 - 01:23:37:01

Yeah,

01:23:37:18 - 01:23:37:37
He is

01:23:37:37 - 01:23:38:20
dead.

01:23:38:20 - 01:23:38:58
Oh,

01:23:38:58 - 01:23:39:48

01:23:39:48 - 01:23:40:06
Oh,

01:23:40:19 - 01:23:40:22
It

01:23:40:22 - 01:23:40:33

Oh,

01:23:43:58 - 01:23:44:56
Well,

01:23:45:41 - 01:23:46:01

01:23:46:01 - 01:23:46:08
His

01:23:46:08 - 01:23:46:33
teammates

01:23:46:33 - 01:23:46:37
are

01:23:46:37 - 01:23:47:07
grieving

01:23:47:07 - 01:23:47:31
him.

01:23:47:31 - 01:23:47:54
Oh,

01:23:48:25 - 01:23:48:34

Fucking.

01:23:58:51 - 01:23:59:20
Oh, I

01:23:59:20 - 01:23:59:36

01:23:59:36 - 01:23:59:46

01:24:10:08 - 01:24:10:39
heavily.

01:24:10:39 - 01:24:10:55
Oh

01:24:11:13 - 01:24:11:36
Damn,

01:24:11:49 - 01:24:12:13

01:24:12:50 - 01:24:13:19

01:24:14:02 - 01:24:14:24

01:24:14:36 - 01:24:14:49
making

01:24:14:49 - 01:24:14:54
his

01:24:14:54 - 01:24:15:16
way.

01:24:15:32 - 01:24:15:41
So,

01:24:15:41 - 01:24:15:59
who's

01:24:15:59 - 01:24:16:28
Nero?

01:24:16:28 - 01:24:17:00
This guy

01:24:17:00 - 01:24:17:18
must

01:24:17:18 - 01:24:17:25
have

01:24:17:25 - 01:24:17:47
been

01:24:17:51 - 01:24:18:01
like,

01:24:18:01 - 01:24:18:09
he's

01:24:18:09 - 01:24:18:21
pretty

01:24:18:21 - 01:24:18:30
good

01:24:18:30 - 01:24:18:59
player.

01:24:18:59 - 01:24:19:13
Doesn't

01:24:19:13 - 01:24:19:21
want

01:24:19:21 - 01:24:19:24
to

01:24:19:24 - 01:24:19:35
show

01:24:19:35 - 01:24:20:04
himself

01:24:20:04 - 01:24:20:07
a

01:24:20:07 - 01:24:20:42
sales

01:24:20:42 - 01:24:20:58
step.

01:24:20:58 - 01:24:21:28
So why

01:24:21:28 - 01:24:21:39
is

01:24:21:39 - 01:24:21:52
your

01:24:21:52 - 01:24:22:15
trading

01:24:22:15 - 01:24:22:26
like

01:24:22:26 - 01:24:22:46
that?

01:24:24:34 - 01:24:24:54
Which

01:24:24:54 - 01:24:25:08
I

01:24:25:08 - 01:24:25:19
think

01:24:25:19 - 01:24:25:42
against

01:24:25:42 - 01:24:26:58
normal.

01:24:27:03 - 01:24:27:09
I

01:24:27:09 - 01:24:27:18
mean,

01:24:27:18 - 01:24:27:37
Lulu

01:24:27:37 - 01:24:27:51
has

01:24:27:51 - 01:24:28:26
refueled.

01:24:28:26 - 01:24:28:46
She's

01:24:28:46 - 01:24:28:58
done

01:24:28:58 - 01:24:29:06
to

01:24:29:06 - 01:24:29:22
trade

01:24:29:22 - 01:24:29:33
like

01:24:29:33 - 01:24:29:52
that.

01:24:29:52 - 01:24:30:03
She's

01:24:30:03 - 01:24:30:14
down

01:24:30:14 - 01:24:30:19
to

01:24:30:19 - 01:24:30:37
trade.

01:24:30:37 - 01:24:31:13
Yeah.

01:24:31:44 - 01:24:32:01
And

01:24:32:03 - 01:24:32:38
it also

01:24:32:38 - 01:24:32:47
just

01:24:32:47 - 01:24:32:58
doesn't

01:24:32:58 - 01:24:33:05
make

01:24:33:05 - 01:24:33:27
any sense

01:24:33:27 - 01:24:33:37
because

01:24:33:37 - 01:24:34:01
the wave

01:24:34:01 - 01:24:34:08
is

01:24:34:08 - 01:24:34:46
coming in

01:24:34:46 - 01:24:34:58
like,

01:24:34:58 - 01:24:35:29
why would you

01:24:35:29 - 01:24:35:45
trade?

01:24:35:45 - 01:24:35:51
You

01:24:35:51 - 01:24:35:54
know,

01:24:35:54 - 01:24:36:16
I feel like

01:24:36:16 - 01:24:36:39
I'm

01:24:36:39 - 01:24:36:57
watching

01:24:36:57 - 01:24:37:10
my

01:24:37:10 - 01:24:37:19
my

01:24:37:19 - 01:24:37:30
soul

01:24:37:30 - 01:24:37:37
with

01:24:37:37 - 01:24:37:42
your

01:24:37:42 - 01:24:38:18
teammates.

01:24:38:18 - 01:24:38:43
I mean,

01:24:38:43 - 01:24:39:01
it's

01:24:39:01 - 01:24:39:28
like

01:24:39:28 - 01:24:39:45
it's

01:24:39:45 - 01:24:40:17
so

01:24:40:17 - 01:24:40:44
crazy.

01:24:40:44 - 01:24:40:55
It's

01:24:40:55 - 01:24:41:13
same

01:24:41:13 - 01:24:41:27
thing

01:24:41:27 - 01:24:41:45
people

01:24:41:45 - 01:24:41:58
doing

01:24:41:58 - 01:24:42:14
made

01:24:42:14 - 01:24:42:41
like

01:24:42:41 - 01:24:43:06
one

01:24:43:06 - 01:24:43:31

01:24:43:31 - 01:24:43:44
has

01:24:43:44 - 01:24:44:00
reefer

01:24:44:00 - 01:24:44:36
bullshit.

01:24:44:36 - 01:24:44:47
You

01:24:44:47 - 01:24:45:32
don't

01:24:45:32 - 01:24:45:39
do

01:24:45:39 - 01:24:45:45
you

01:24:45:45 - 01:24:46:08
type

01:24:46:08 - 01:24:46:19
like

01:24:46:19 - 01:24:46:22
you

01:24:46:22 - 01:24:46:30
have

01:24:46:30 - 01:24:46:46
zero.

01:24:46:46 - 01:24:46:53
Of

01:24:46:53 - 01:24:47:04
course

01:24:47:04 - 01:24:47:09
you

01:24:47:09 - 01:24:47:24
trade.

01:24:47:24 - 01:24:48:01
Yeah,

01:24:48:05 - 01:24:48:25
yeah,

01:24:48:25 - 01:24:48:48
of course

01:24:48:48 - 01:24:48:54
you

01:24:48:54 - 01:24:49:08
trade

01:24:49:08 - 01:24:49:23
it.

01:24:49:23 - 01:24:49:58
Yeah,

01:24:50:24 - 01:24:50:55
yeah.

01:24:52:21 - 01:24:52:26
The

01:24:52:26 - 01:24:52:55
spear

01:24:52:55 - 01:24:53:20
finds

01:24:53:20 - 01:24:53:29
his

01:24:53:29 - 01:24:54:14
mark.

01:24:54:14 - 01:24:54:41
All right.

01:24:54:41 - 01:24:55:03
Once

01:24:55:03 - 01:24:55:28
again,

01:24:55:28 - 01:24:56:16
I feel like

01:24:56:20 - 01:24:56:33
just

01:24:56:33 - 01:24:57:00
having

01:24:57:00 - 01:24:57:05
the

01:24:57:05 - 01:24:57:30
read

01:24:57:30 - 01:24:57:55
on how

01:24:57:55 - 01:24:58:17
to play

01:24:58:17 - 01:24:58:39
around.

01:24:58:39 - 01:24:58:46
Do

01:24:58:46 - 01:24:59:00

An

01:25:00:30 - 01:25:01:33
alliance,

01:25:01:33 - 01:25:02:11
selfish

01:25:02:11 - 01:25:02:18

01:25:02:20 - 01:25:02:52
themselves,

01:25:02:52 - 01:25:03:09
Which is.

01:25:03:09 - 01:25:03:18
Is a

01:25:03:18 - 01:25:03:54
male?

01:25:03:54 - 01:25:04:06
Yeah,

01:25:04:06 - 01:25:04:19
she's

01:25:04:19 - 01:25:04:24
an

01:25:04:24 - 01:25:04:42

Do you

01:25:06:27 - 01:25:06:37

01:25:06:37 - 01:25:07:10
Well,

01:25:07:10 - 01:25:07:26
I'll be

01:25:07:26 - 01:25:07:40
knocked

01:25:07:40 - 01:25:07:55
out.

01:25:08:02 - 01:25:08:25
No,

01:25:08:25 - 01:25:08:58
I have never

01:25:08:58 - 01:25:09:23
played.

01:25:09:23 - 01:25:09:50
Okay.

01:25:09:50 - 01:25:10:13
I have

01:25:10:13 - 01:25:10:31

01:25:10:31 - 01:25:10:46

01:25:13:44 - 01:25:13:54
for

01:25:14:22 - 01:25:14:38
maybe

01:25:14:38 - 01:25:14:52
less,

01:25:14:52 - 01:25:15:05
Maybe

01:25:15:05 - 01:25:15:16
like

01:25:15:16 - 01:25:15:59
four

01:25:16:04 - 01:25:16:26
doesn't

01:25:16:26 - 01:25:17:12
go on.

01:25:17:12 - 01:25:17:31
Oh my.

01:25:17:31 - 01:25:17:45
Only.

01:25:18:05 - 01:25:18:43
a bit.

01:25:18:43 - 01:25:19:03
I think

01:25:19:03 - 01:25:19:39
100

01:25:19:39 - 01:25:20:47
was for

01:25:20:47 - 01:25:21:01
me.

01:25:21:03 - 01:25:21:34
Those are

01:25:21:34 - 01:25:22:39
35.

01:25:22:39 - 01:25:23:00
I'm

01:25:23:00 - 01:25:23:22
playing

01:25:23:22 - 01:25:23:54
hardcore

01:25:23:54 - 01:25:24:04
to

01:25:24:04 - 01:25:24:37
classic.

01:25:24:37 - 01:25:24:52
So

01:25:24:52 - 01:25:25:13
if I.

01:25:25:13 - 01:25:25:26
If

01:25:25:26 - 01:25:26:16
I die,

01:25:26:16 - 01:25:26:56
I lose

01:25:26:56 - 01:25:27:05
my

01:25:27:05 - 01:25:27:36
character

01:25:27:36 - 01:25:27:59
starting

01:25:27:59 - 01:25:28:10
to.

01:25:28:21 - 01:25:28:33
Oh,

01:25:29:40 - 01:25:30:03
yeah,

01:25:30:07 - 01:25:30:24
yeah.

01:25:30:48 - 01:25:31:21
Starting

01:25:31:21 - 01:25:31:26
to

01:25:31:26 - 01:25:31:39
hover

01:25:31:39 - 01:25:31:46
up

01:25:31:46 - 01:25:32:01
towards

01:25:32:01 - 01:25:32:07
that

01:25:32:07 - 01:25:32:22
top

01:25:32:22 - 01:25:32:36
side.

01:25:32:36 - 01:25:32:54
But

01:25:32:54 - 01:25:33:11
I think

01:25:33:11 - 01:25:33:21
Finn

01:25:33:21 - 01:25:33:28
just

01:25:33:28 - 01:25:33:43
wants

01:25:33:43 - 01:25:33:46
to

01:25:33:46 - 01:25:33:55
make

01:25:33:55 - 01:25:34:03
sure

01:25:34:03 - 01:25:34:10
you

01:25:34:24 - 01:25:34:39
can

01:25:34:39 - 01:25:35:07
afford

01:25:35:07 - 01:25:35:22
it

01:25:35:22 - 01:25:35:33
even

01:25:35:33 - 01:25:35:40
up

01:25:35:40 - 01:25:35:51
to him

01:25:35:51 - 01:25:35:58
for

01:25:35:58 - 01:25:36:01
the

01:25:36:01 - 01:25:36:19
call

01:25:36:19 - 01:25:36:46
Hill

01:25:36:46 - 01:25:37:01
top

01:25:37:01 - 01:25:37:12
this

01:25:37:12 - 01:25:38:07
looking

01:25:38:07 - 01:25:38:54
juicy

01:25:38:54 - 01:25:39:01
to

01:25:39:01 - 01:25:39:23
this

01:25:39:23 - 01:25:39:52
topside

01:25:39:52 - 01:25:40:13
matching

01:25:40:13 - 01:25:41:12
gifts.

01:25:41:15 - 01:25:41:27
I

01:25:41:27 - 01:25:41:57
wonder

01:25:41:57 - 01:25:43:42
if that was

01:25:43:42 - 01:25:44:54
killed

01:25:44:54 - 01:25:45:03
like

01:25:45:03 - 01:25:45:32
redacted.

01:25:45:32 - 01:25:45:41
He's

01:25:45:41 - 01:25:45:55
going

01:25:45:55 - 01:25:46:10
cold.

his

01:26:46:17 - 01:26:46:49
authority

01:26:46:49 - 01:26:47:07

01:27:08:20 - 01:27:08:49

01:27:11:49 - 01:27:11:56

01:27:11:56 - 01:27:12:07
might

01:27:12:07 - 01:27:13:10

Let's

aggression.

01:27:21:34 - 01:27:21:55
Oh,

Oh,

01:27:29:54 - 01:27:30:05
We're

01:27:30:19 - 01:27:30:30

Now

01:27:37:01 - 01:27:37:15
try to

01:27:37:15 - 01:27:37:30
position.

01:27:37:30 - 01:27:37:44
Oh,

01:27:37:44 - 01:27:37:51
my

01:27:37:51 - 01:27:38:06
God.

01:27:38:06 - 01:27:39:25
Where weak

01:27:39:25 - 01:27:39:39
because

01:27:39:39 - 01:27:39:48
I'm.

01:27:39:48 - 01:27:40:28
He can

01:27:40:30 - 01:27:40:42
go

01:27:40:42 - 01:27:40:51
over

01:27:40:51 - 01:27:41:24
walls

01:27:41:24 - 01:27:41:34
and

01:27:41:34 - 01:27:41:43
it's

01:27:41:43 - 01:27:42:21
tense

01:27:42:21 - 01:27:42:45
only

01:27:42:45 - 01:27:43:01
on the

01:27:43:01 - 01:27:43:37
walls.

01:27:44:09 - 01:27:44:27
Oh,

01:27:44:27 - 01:27:45:03
okay.

01:27:45:03 - 01:27:45:27
Okay.

01:27:45:27 - 01:27:45:37
I'm

01:27:45:37 - 01:27:45:45
like,

01:27:45:45 - 01:27:45:54
wait

01:27:45:54 - 01:27:46:08
a minute.

01:27:46:08 - 01:27:46:24
Can he

01:27:46:24 - 01:27:46:51
jungle

01:27:46:51 - 01:27:47:20
like

01:27:47:20 - 01:27:47:33
it's.

01:27:47:33 - 01:27:48:04
No,

01:27:48:37 - 01:27:48:46
he

01:27:48:46 - 01:27:49:04
can.

01:27:49:04 - 01:27:49:28
He can

01:27:49:28 - 01:27:49:40
if

01:27:49:40 - 01:27:50:38
someone is around

01:27:50:38 - 01:27:50:51
because

01:27:50:51 - 01:27:51:01
then

01:27:51:01 - 01:27:51:09
he

01:27:51:09 - 01:27:51:27
steals.

01:27:51:27 - 01:27:51:34
That

01:27:51:34 - 01:27:51:50
guy

01:27:51:50 - 01:27:52:30
would be

01:27:52:30 - 01:27:52:44
that

01:27:52:44 - 01:27:53:07
also.

01:27:53:07 - 01:27:53:36
Oh

01:27:53:36 - 01:27:53:56
okay.

01:27:53:56 - 01:27:54:10
Okay.

01:27:54:10 - 01:27:54:19
Can

01:27:54:19 - 01:27:54:23
you

01:27:54:23 - 01:27:54:34
jump

01:27:54:34 - 01:27:54:59
towards

01:27:54:59 - 01:27:55:04
are

01:27:55:04 - 01:27:55:37
now

01:27:55:37 - 01:27:56:00
seven

01:27:56:00 - 01:27:56:11
in

01:27:56:11 - 01:27:56:50
position.

01:27:56:50 - 01:27:57:19
No,

01:27:57:19 - 01:27:57:32
don't

01:27:57:32 - 01:27:57:46
think

01:27:57:46 - 01:27:58:12
so.

01:27:59:25 - 01:27:59:36
Well

01:27:59:36 - 01:28:00:07
I think

01:28:00:07 - 01:28:00:37
if he

01:28:00:37 - 01:28:01:08
if he

01:28:01:08 - 01:28:01:30
can do

01:28:01:30 - 01:28:01:58
that

01:28:02:04 - 01:28:02:18
even

01:28:02:18 - 01:28:02:40
without

01:28:02:40 - 01:28:03:19
the old form

01:28:03:19 - 01:28:03:37
but

01:28:03:37 - 01:28:04:15
on the old

01:28:04:15 - 01:28:04:30
I think

01:28:04:30 - 01:28:04:46
he can

01:28:04:46 - 01:28:05:04
do it

01:28:05:04 - 01:28:05:24
alone.

01:28:05:24 - 01:28:05:34
That's

01:28:05:34 - 01:28:06:07
what I

01:28:06:07 - 01:28:06:41
remember.

01:28:06:41 - 01:28:06:48
But

01:28:06:48 - 01:28:06:55
I'm

01:28:06:55 - 01:28:07:04
not

01:28:07:04 - 01:28:07:22
sure.

01:28:07:22 - 01:28:07:42
Maybe

01:28:07:42 - 01:28:08:07
the second

01:28:08:07 - 01:28:08:33
is

01:28:08:58 - 01:28:09:10
about

01:28:09:10 - 01:28:09:21
to

01:28:09:21 - 01:28:10:10
finally

01:28:10:10 - 01:28:10:33
go.

01:28:10:33 - 01:28:11:24
You

01:28:11:24 - 01:28:11:49
know?

01:28:12:08 - 01:28:12:32
Oh,

01:28:12:32 - 01:28:12:59
my

01:28:12:59 - 01:28:14:27
God,

01:28:14:27 - 01:28:14:34
I

01:28:14:34 - 01:28:15:02
don't know

01:28:15:39 - 01:28:15:53
how

01:28:16:15 - 01:28:16:31
we get

01:28:16:31 - 01:28:16:42
like

01:28:16:42 - 01:28:16:58
this

01:28:16:58 - 01:28:17:06
on

01:28:17:06 - 01:28:17:34
both sides

01:28:17:34 - 01:28:17:47
so

01:28:17:47 - 01:28:18:07
my boy

01:28:18:07 - 01:28:18:18
can

01:28:18:18 - 01:28:18:43
play

01:28:18:43 - 01:28:19:01
first

01:28:19:01 - 01:28:19:31
happening.

01:28:19:31 - 01:28:20:51
Oh,

01:28:20:51 - 01:28:21:54
yeah

01:28:21:54 - 01:28:22:31
Mira.

01:28:22:31 - 01:28:24:48
No,

01:28:24:48 - 01:28:25:49
of course

01:28:25:49 - 01:28:26:42
I was

01:28:26:42 - 01:28:27:05
cautious.

01:28:27:05 - 01:28:27:10
Did

01:28:27:10 - 01:28:27:39
not make

01:28:27:39 - 01:28:28:12
it up.

01:28:28:13 - 01:28:28:30
Even

01:28:28:30 - 01:28:28:55
scorched

01:28:28:55 - 01:28:29:25
in there.

01:28:29:25 - 01:28:29:42
If he had

01:28:29:42 - 01:28:30:12
gathering,

01:28:30:12 - 01:28:30:19
he

01:28:30:19 - 01:28:30:37
killed

01:28:30:37 - 01:28:30:48
there.

01:28:30:48 - 01:28:31:17
Actually,

01:28:33:01 - 01:28:33:14
it's

01:28:33:14 - 01:28:33:30
10

01:28:33:30 - 01:28:33:46
minutes.

01:28:33:46 - 01:28:33:54
It's

01:28:33:54 - 01:28:34:08
10

01:28:34:08 - 01:28:34:22
minutes.

01:28:34:22 - 01:28:35:27
What do you mean?

01:28:35:37 - 01:28:35:54
Like

01:28:35:54 - 01:28:36:10
you.

01:28:36:10 - 01:28:36:48
He can keep

01:28:36:48 - 01:28:36:57
look

01:28:36:57 - 01:28:37:19
scorched

01:28:37:19 - 01:28:37:28
like

01:28:37:28 - 01:28:38:02
two times

01:28:38:02 - 01:28:38:16
in this

01:28:38:16 - 01:28:38:40
fight.

01:28:38:40 - 01:28:38:51
No,

01:28:38:51 - 01:28:39:21
you can

01:28:39:21 - 01:28:39:43
scorch

01:28:39:43 - 01:28:39:52
two

01:28:39:52 - 01:28:40:13
times

01:28:40:13 - 01:28:40:21
in

01:28:40:21 - 01:28:40:39
ten.

01:28:41:05 - 01:28:41:17
Well,

01:28:41:37 - 01:28:42:06
is

01:28:42:33 - 01:28:42:50
you're

01:28:42:50 - 01:28:43:44
saying

01:28:44:11 - 01:28:44:29
No,

01:28:44:29 - 01:28:45:28
I love

01:28:45:28 - 01:28:46:03
me.

01:28:46:03 - 01:28:46:57
Really?

01:28:47:00 - 01:28:47:20
Yeah.

01:28:47:20 - 01:28:47:29
It

01:28:47:29 - 01:28:47:54
looks

01:28:48:09 - 01:28:48:34
like.

01:28:48:36 - 01:28:48:52
Got to

01:28:48:52 - 01:28:49:12
really

01:28:49:12 - 01:28:49:34
fight,

01:28:49:34 - 01:28:49:58
though.

01:28:49:58 - 01:28:50:24
Like

01:28:50:42 - 01:28:51:01
the way

01:28:51:01 - 01:28:51:09
I

01:28:51:09 - 01:28:51:28
think.

01:28:51:28 - 01:28:51:36
I

01:28:51:36 - 01:28:51:54
really

01:28:51:54 - 01:28:52:26
I mean,

01:28:52:26 - 01:28:52:37
right

01:28:52:37 - 01:28:52:46
now.

01:28:52:46 - 01:28:52:57
So

01:28:52:57 - 01:28:53:07
it's

01:28:53:07 - 01:28:53:22
very

01:28:53:22 - 01:28:53:34
good.

01:28:53:34 - 01:28:53:56
I think

01:28:53:56 - 01:28:54:19
that makes

01:28:54:19 - 01:28:54:25
the

01:28:54:25 - 01:28:54:59
plays.

01:28:54:59 - 01:28:55:31
I mean,

01:28:55:31 - 01:28:55:44
it

01:28:55:44 - 01:28:56:04
should be

01:28:56:04 - 01:28:56:15
like,

01:28:56:15 - 01:28:56:38
okay,

01:28:56:38 - 01:28:56:51
like

01:28:56:51 - 01:28:57:03
this

01:28:57:03 - 01:28:57:21
game.

01:28:57:21 - 01:28:57:46
I think

01:28:57:46 - 01:28:58:01
it.

01:28:58:24 - 01:28:58:51
I think

01:28:58:51 - 01:28:58:58
it

01:28:58:58 - 01:28:59:20
popped

01:28:59:20 - 01:28:59:36
off.

01:28:59:36 - 01:29:00:23
I think,

01:29:00:36 - 01:29:00:52
okay,

01:29:00:52 - 01:29:01:15
this game

01:29:01:15 - 01:29:01:30
is

01:29:01:40 - 01:29:01:58
Yeah,

01:29:01:58 - 01:29:02:13
this

01:29:02:13 - 01:29:02:38
game.

01:29:02:38 - 01:29:02:49
He

01:29:02:49 - 01:29:03:07
popped

01:29:03:07 - 01:29:03:18
off

01:29:03:18 - 01:29:03:46
of it.

01:29:03:46 - 01:29:04:30
Not quite,

01:29:04:37 - 01:29:04:57
but

01:29:04:57 - 01:29:05:07
I'm

01:29:05:07 - 01:29:05:18
not

01:29:05:18 - 01:29:05:36
sure

01:29:05:36 - 01:29:06:18
if you can

01:29:06:18 - 01:29:06:39
do it

01:29:06:39 - 01:29:06:46
or

01:29:06:46 - 01:29:07:10
that

01:29:07:10 - 01:29:07:17
I'm

01:29:07:17 - 01:29:07:30
getting

01:29:07:30 - 01:29:07:57
betrayed

01:29:07:57 - 01:29:08:13
Live

01:31:47:31 - 01:31:48:45

01:31:50:42 - 01:31:51:34
license

01:31:51:34 - 01:31:51:55
plate

01:31:52:56 - 01:31:53:42
to be

You're

01:32:04:55 - 01:32:05:13
actually

01:32:05:13 - 01:32:05:30
doing

01:32:05:30 - 01:32:05:42
it

01:32:06:21 - 01:32:06:52
now.

01:32:07:04 - 01:32:07:33
Certainly

01:32:07:33 - 01:32:07:50
no

01:32:08:09 - 01:32:09:14
reduction

01:32:10:11 - 01:32:10:19

01:32:10:48 - 01:32:10:58
He's

01:32:10:58 - 01:32:11:24
zero

01:32:11:24 - 01:32:11:31
one

01:32:11:31 - 01:32:12:06
for

01:32:12:37 - 01:32:13:21
very

01:32:14:40 - 01:32:15:41
different.

01:32:18:59 - 01:32:19:08
You

01:32:19:08 - 01:32:19:24
get

01:32:19:24 - 01:32:19:39
make

01:32:19:39 - 01:32:19:49
this

01:32:19:49 - 01:32:20:04
shit

01:32:20:04 - 01:32:20:29
up

01:32:23:44 - 01:32:25:35
the snowball

01:32:25:35 - 01:32:26:18

01:32:26:52 - 01:32:27:32
MasterCard.

01:32:27:32 - 01:32:27:43
Go

01:32:27:43 - 01:32:28:42
do this.

01:32:28:42 - 01:32:29:02
The fact

01:32:29:02 - 01:32:29:13
that

01:32:29:38 - 01:32:30:21
toppling

01:32:30:26 - 01:32:30:37
of

01:32:30:41 - 01:32:31:06
gold,

01:32:31:06 - 01:32:31:21
I

01:32:31:21 - 01:32:31:37
guess

01:32:31:48 - 01:32:32:07
that's

01:32:32:09 - 01:32:32:13
the

01:32:32:13 - 01:32:32:34
show

01:32:32:34 - 01:32:32:58

01:32:33:45 - 01:32:34:24
to this.

01:32:39:46 - 01:32:40:26
So as

01:32:40:26 - 01:32:40:40
soon

01:32:40:40 - 01:32:40:51
as

01:32:40:51 - 01:32:41:25

01:32:41:25 - 01:32:41:38

we'll be

01:32:45:54 - 01:32:47:36

01:32:47:36 - 01:32:48:27
primary

01:32:48:27 - 01:32:48:59
tools.

01:32:49:53 - 01:32:50:04

keep

01:34:05:22 - 01:34:05:37

01:34:05:40 - 01:34:05:45
I

01:34:05:45 - 01:34:06:16
don't think

01:34:06:16 - 01:34:06:27

01:34:11:11 - 01:34:11:28
dog

01:34:11:28 - 01:34:11:38
was

01:34:11:38 - 01:34:12:19
insane

01:34:12:19 - 01:34:12:28
trying

01:34:12:28 - 01:34:12:34
to

01:34:12:34 - 01:34:13:30
keep the wave

01:34:13:30 - 01:34:13:39
and

01:34:13:39 - 01:34:13:53
then

01:34:13:53 - 01:34:13:58
you're

01:34:13:58 - 01:34:14:07
right

01:34:14:07 - 01:34:14:25

01:34:17:56 - 01:34:18:05
that

01:34:18:05 - 01:34:18:55
one off

01:34:18:55 - 01:34:19:24
so

01:34:19:26 - 01:34:19:37
even

01:34:19:37 - 01:34:19:46
now

01:34:19:46 - 01:34:20:02
you can

01:34:20:02 - 01:34:20:45

01:34:21:14 - 01:34:21:43

is an

01:34:22:12 - 01:34:23:27
uphill

01:34:24:05 - 01:34:24:16
that

01:34:24:16 - 01:34:24:39

01:34:24:39 - 01:34:25:03
imported

01:34:25:03 - 01:34:25:46

objective

01:34:26:33 - 01:34:26:51
is

01:34:26:51 - 01:34:27:41
an important

01:34:27:41 - 01:34:28:06
yeah

01:34:28:13 - 01:34:28:22
they're

01:34:28:22 - 01:34:28:31
way

01:34:28:31 - 01:34:28:46
back

01:34:28:46 - 01:34:28:55
in

01:34:28:55 - 01:34:29:22
now.

01:34:29:22 - 01:34:29:36
I wonder

01:34:29:36 - 01:34:29:42
what

01:34:29:42 - 01:34:30:00
living in

01:34:30:00 - 01:34:30:14
China

01:34:30:21 - 01:34:30:39
like

01:34:30:39 - 01:34:31:07
then

01:34:31:48 - 01:34:31:58
and

01:34:31:58 - 01:34:32:20
again

01:34:32:20 - 01:34:32:34
like

01:34:32:34 - 01:34:32:52
if you

01:34:32:52 - 01:34:33:03
can

01:34:33:03 - 01:34:33:16
get

01:34:33:16 - 01:34:33:45
this.

01:34:33:48 - 01:34:34:10
Hmm.

01:34:34:10 - 01:34:34:17
A

01:34:34:30 - 01:34:34:48
couple

01:34:34:48 - 01:34:34:51
of

01:34:34:51 - 01:34:35:04
more

01:34:35:04 - 01:34:35:27
levels.

01:34:35:27 - 01:34:35:43
Game

01:34:35:43 - 01:34:35:52
sea

01:34:35:52 - 01:34:36:07
level

01:34:36:07 - 01:34:36:48
11,

01:34:37:10 - 01:34:37:13

01:34:37:16 - 01:34:37:37
couple of

01:34:37:37 - 01:34:37:53
items

01:34:37:53 - 01:34:38:04
under

01:34:38:04 - 01:34:38:43
threat

01:34:38:49 - 01:34:39:03
belt.

01:34:39:03 - 01:34:39:52
Maybe

01:34:39:52 - 01:34:40:03
there's

01:34:40:03 - 01:34:40:08
an

01:34:40:08 - 01:34:40:40
opportunity,

01:34:40:40 - 01:34:41:06
but

01:34:41:06 - 01:34:41:16
he's

01:34:41:16 - 01:34:41:24
just

01:34:41:24 - 01:34:41:43
struggling

01:34:41:43 - 01:34:41:54

01:34:41:54 - 01:34:42:12
much.

01:34:42:12 - 01:34:42:25
They're

01:34:42:25 - 01:34:42:37
like

01:34:42:37 - 01:34:42:55

01:34:44:13 - 01:34:44:42
sidelines,

01:34:44:42 - 01:34:44:50
which

01:34:47:07 - 01:34:47:43
I hate

01:34:47:43 - 01:34:48:05

01:34:56:29 - 01:34:56:58
rushing.

01:34:56:58 - 01:34:57:52
Landry,

01:34:57:52 - 01:34:58:03
I'm

01:34:58:03 - 01:34:58:35
cringing

01:34:58:35 - 01:34:58:51
so

01:34:58:51 - 01:34:59:16
hard.

01:34:59:16 - 01:34:59:42
Oh

01:34:59:58 - 01:35:00:46
yes.

01:35:00:46 - 01:35:01:01
From

01:35:01:01 - 01:35:01:06
the

01:35:01:06 - 01:35:01:28
team

01:35:01:28 - 01:35:01:44
and

01:35:01:44 - 01:35:02:07
quiet

01:35:02:07 - 01:35:02:27

So

your champ

01:35:05:36 - 01:35:05:43
is

01:35:05:43 - 01:35:06:09
merely

01:35:06:09 - 01:35:06:30
champ.

01:35:06:30 - 01:35:07:10
Basically

01:35:07:10 - 01:35:07:35
your champ

01:35:07:35 - 01:35:07:44
is

01:35:07:44 - 01:35:08:02
melee

01:35:08:02 - 01:35:08:16

one

01:35:41:18 - 01:35:42:32

01:35:42:50 - 01:35:43:48

01:35:44:18 - 01:35:44:27

the one

01:35:48:28 - 01:35:48:55
but he

01:35:48:55 - 01:35:49:17
I think

01:35:49:17 - 01:35:50:29
his grandmaster

01:35:50:29 - 01:35:51:19
to do it

01:35:56:56 - 01:35:57:13

01:35:57:13 - 01:35:57:33

this is

01:36:17:49 - 01:36:17:58
not

01:36:17:58 - 01:36:18:03

01:36:18:03 - 01:36:18:23
first

01:36:18:23 - 01:36:18:42

01:37:30:39 - 01:37:30:54
though

01:37:30:54 - 01:37:31:19
we get to

01:37:31:19 - 01:37:31:37
see an

01:37:31:37 - 01:37:31:58
O'Reilly

01:37:31:58 - 01:37:32:06
in

01:37:32:06 - 01:37:32:36
Seoul

01:37:32:36 - 01:37:32:56
where

01:37:32:56 - 01:37:33:23
everyone

01:37:33:23 - 01:37:33:37
says

01:37:33:37 - 01:37:34:13
the champions

01:37:34:13 - 01:37:34:22
like

01:37:34:22 - 01:37:34:40
weak

01:37:34:40 - 01:37:34:48
and

01:37:34:48 - 01:37:34:58
like

01:37:34:58 - 01:37:35:11
not

01:37:35:11 - 01:37:35:25
good

01:37:35:25 - 01:37:35:31
and

01:37:35:31 - 01:37:35:42
like

01:37:35:42 - 01:37:36:05
clearly

01:37:36:05 - 01:37:36:21
it's

01:37:36:21 - 01:37:37:04
it's

01:37:37:19 - 01:37:38:11
very strong,

01:37:38:11 - 01:37:38:51
you know

01:37:39:16 - 01:37:39:32
I mean

01:37:39:32 - 01:37:39:58
I don't

01:37:39:58 - 01:37:40:10
to be

01:37:40:10 - 01:37:40:21
like

01:37:40:21 - 01:37:40:46
Brazil

01:37:40:46 - 01:37:41:29
business

01:37:41:29 - 01:37:41:49
I think

01:37:41:49 - 01:37:42:14
Jesus

01:37:42:14 - 01:37:42:28
really

01:37:42:28 - 01:37:42:50
greased

01:37:42:50 - 01:37:43:01
it

01:37:43:01 - 01:37:44:02
that's an out

01:37:44:02 - 01:37:45:01
takes them

01:37:45:01 - 01:37:45:33
like

01:37:45:45 - 01:37:46:07
well

01:37:46:12 - 01:37:46:35
you know

01:37:46:35 - 01:37:46:49
like

01:37:46:49 - 01:37:46:55
you

01:37:46:55 - 01:37:47:20
should not

01:37:47:20 - 01:37:47:31
be

01:37:47:31 - 01:37:47:58
having

01:37:47:58 - 01:37:48:09
to

01:37:48:09 - 01:37:48:52
base

01:37:48:52 - 01:37:49:03
that

01:37:49:21 - 01:37:50:04
level

01:37:50:09 - 01:37:50:31
before

01:37:50:31 - 01:37:50:52
see us

01:37:50:52 - 01:37:51:19
you know

01:37:51:19 - 01:37:51:54
Yeah.

01:37:51:54 - 01:37:52:29
Inhibitors.

01:37:52:29 - 01:37:53:11
No no

01:37:53:11 - 01:37:53:24
minute

01:37:53:24 - 01:37:53:38
mark

01:37:53:38 - 01:37:54:28
is crested

01:37:54:28 - 01:37:54:37
and

01:37:54:37 - 01:37:54:45
they're

01:37:54:45 - 01:37:55:19
looking

01:37:55:19 - 01:37:55:40
to go

01:37:55:40 - 01:37:56:31
for next.

01:37:56:31 - 01:37:56:40
I

01:37:56:40 - 01:37:57:01
don't know

01:37:57:01 - 01:37:57:39
exactly

01:37:57:39 - 01:37:58:06
what I

01:37:58:06 - 01:37:58:15
don't

01:37:58:15 - 01:37:58:22
they

01:37:58:22 - 01:37:58:33
can't

01:37:58:33 - 01:37:58:44
can

01:37:58:44 - 01:37:59:02
access

01:37:59:02 - 01:37:59:18
turrets

01:37:59:18 - 01:37:59:27
right

01:37:59:27 - 01:37:59:45
now.

01:37:59:58 - 01:38:00:39
Yeah.

01:38:00:39 - 01:38:01:51
They have to back off

01:38:01:51 - 01:38:02:27
going away

01:38:02:27 - 01:38:02:34
and

01:38:02:34 - 01:38:02:56
I think

01:38:02:56 - 01:38:03:32
G2

01:38:03:32 - 01:38:03:48
will

01:38:03:48 - 01:38:04:10
keep

01:38:04:10 - 01:38:04:24
that

01:38:04:24 - 01:38:04:49
red

01:38:04:49 - 01:38:05:16
fun.

01:38:05:20 - 01:38:05:47
Oh

01:38:05:47 - 01:38:06:59
my God

01:38:06:59 - 01:38:07:17
they want

01:38:07:17 - 01:38:07:37
to try

01:38:07:37 - 01:38:07:58
and

01:38:08:29 - 01:38:08:58
actually

01:38:08:58 - 01:38:09:32
crazy

01:38:09:32 - 01:38:10:48
go

01:38:10:48 - 01:38:11:04
finish

01:38:11:04 - 01:38:11:16
back

01:38:11:16 - 01:38:11:27
away

01:38:11:27 - 01:38:11:36
from

01:38:11:36 - 01:38:11:47
this

01:38:11:47 - 01:38:11:58
chair,

01:38:11:58 - 01:38:12:27
go off

01:38:12:27 - 01:38:12:36
of

01:38:12:36 - 01:38:13:15
Nautilus.

01:38:14:36 - 01:38:14:45
But

01:38:14:45 - 01:38:14:56
once

01:38:14:56 - 01:38:15:03
they

01:38:15:03 - 01:38:15:16
get

01:38:15:16 - 01:38:15:58
that,

01:38:16:12 - 01:38:16:24
what

01:38:16:24 - 01:38:16:53
do you do

01:38:16:53 - 01:38:17:29
This?

01:38:17:29 - 01:38:18:00
Oh, my

01:38:18:00 - 01:38:18:49
Lord.

01:38:18:49 - 01:38:19:08
Outside

01:38:19:08 - 01:38:19:12
of

01:38:19:12 - 01:38:19:37
your face

01:38:19:37 - 01:38:19:49
still

01:38:19:49 - 01:38:20:22
remaining

01:38:20:22 - 01:38:20:29
on

01:38:20:29 - 01:38:20:38
that

01:38:20:38 - 01:38:20:51
top

01:38:20:51 - 01:38:21:19
Sitemap

01:38:21:19 - 01:38:21:36
and

01:38:21:42 - 01:38:22:06
the LG

01:38:22:06 - 01:38:22:15
aren't

01:38:22:15 - 01:38:22:24
even

01:38:22:24 - 01:38:22:31
going

01:38:22:31 - 01:38:22:55
to reset.

01:38:22:55 - 01:38:23:00
They

01:38:23:00 - 01:38:23:11
said,

01:38:23:11 - 01:38:23:33
Look,

01:38:23:33 - 01:38:23:47
I mean,

01:38:23:47 - 01:38:24:03
to be

01:38:24:03 - 01:38:24:45
honest,

01:38:24:45 - 01:38:25:35
like

01:38:25:51 - 01:38:26:18
after

01:38:26:18 - 01:38:26:29
this

01:38:26:29 - 01:38:26:51
shit

01:38:26:51 - 01:38:27:21
happened.

01:38:27:21 - 01:38:28:08
But I

01:38:28:08 - 01:38:28:17
have

01:38:28:17 - 01:38:28:40
a moment

01:38:28:40 - 01:38:28:48
here,

01:38:28:48 - 01:38:29:42
Doctor.

01:38:29:52 - 01:38:30:18
I think

01:38:30:18 - 01:38:31:21
anatomically

01:38:31:21 - 01:38:31:35
you've

01:38:31:35 - 01:38:31:55
see

01:38:31:55 - 01:38:32:12
all

01:38:32:12 - 01:38:32:25
the

01:38:32:25 - 01:38:33:18
lions

01:38:33:18 - 01:38:33:32
moving

01:38:33:32 - 01:38:33:51
over,

01:38:33:51 - 01:38:34:07
though.

01:38:34:42 - 01:38:35:02
I know

01:38:35:02 - 01:38:35:09
it

01:38:35:09 - 01:38:36:07
sucks,

01:38:36:07 - 01:38:36:16
but

01:38:36:16 - 01:38:36:37
they kind

01:38:36:37 - 01:38:36:43
of

01:38:36:43 - 01:38:36:54
like

01:38:36:54 - 01:38:37:55
back off

01:38:37:55 - 01:38:38:16
and

01:38:38:16 - 01:38:38:33
yeah,

01:38:38:33 - 01:38:38:47
they will

01:38:38:47 - 01:38:38:56
go

01:38:38:56 - 01:38:39:18
down

01:38:39:18 - 01:38:39:52
16th.

01:38:39:52 - 01:38:40:35
Yes.

01:38:40:40 - 01:38:40:48
Or

01:38:40:48 - 01:38:41:13
even

01:38:41:16 - 01:38:41:38
base

01:38:41:38 - 01:38:41:54
one of

01:38:41:54 - 01:38:42:23
this.

01:38:42:23 - 01:38:42:34
Like

01:38:42:34 - 01:38:42:46
I feel

01:38:42:46 - 01:38:42:54
like

01:38:42:54 - 01:38:43:03
the

01:38:43:03 - 01:38:43:24
top

01:38:43:24 - 01:38:43:31
was

01:38:43:31 - 01:38:43:51
already

01:38:43:51 - 01:38:44:27
so far

01:38:44:27 - 01:38:44:52
ahead.

01:38:44:52 - 01:38:45:54
We will

01:38:45:54 - 01:38:46:37
go.

01:38:46:37 - 01:38:46:46
It

01:38:46:49 - 01:38:47:25
takes it

01:38:47:25 - 01:38:48:34
anyway.

01:38:48:34 - 01:38:48:57
Oh,

01:38:49:01 - 01:38:49:44
damn.

01:38:49:53 - 01:38:50:18
His

01:38:50:18 - 01:38:50:58
moment.

01:38:50:58 - 01:38:51:09
Oh,

01:38:51:09 - 01:38:51:23
my

01:38:51:23 - 01:38:51:43
God.

01:38:51:43 - 01:38:51:52
Wait.

01:38:51:52 - 01:38:52:28
Why did I say

01:38:52:28 - 01:38:52:39
took

01:38:52:39 - 01:38:52:58
Baron

01:38:52:58 - 01:38:53:22
twice,

01:38:53:22 - 01:38:53:40
though?

01:38:53:40 - 01:38:53:52
What

01:38:53:52 - 01:38:54:00
was

01:38:54:00 - 01:38:54:10
that

01:38:54:10 - 01:38:54:16
all

01:38:54:16 - 01:38:54:36
about?

01:38:54:36 - 01:38:54:55
It's

01:38:54:55 - 01:38:55:49
always.

01:38:55:49 - 01:38:56:00
Oh,

01:38:56:00 - 01:38:56:15
really?

01:38:56:15 - 01:38:56:54
Okay.

01:38:57:28 - 01:38:57:40
Like

01:38:57:49 - 01:38:58:37
it's.

01:38:58:37 - 01:38:58:53
No,

01:38:58:53 - 01:38:59:11
it's

01:38:59:11 - 01:38:59:22
like

01:38:59:22 - 01:38:59:31
when

01:38:59:31 - 01:38:59:34
you

01:38:59:34 - 01:39:00:23
steal

01:39:00:23 - 01:39:00:41
twice.

01:39:00:41 - 01:39:01:01
I don't know

01:39:01:01 - 01:39:01:24
why.

01:39:01:24 - 01:39:01:50
Yeah.

01:39:01:50 - 01:39:02:24
Glorious

01:39:02:24 - 01:39:02:43
moment

01:39:02:43 - 01:39:02:58

I don't

01:39:14:00 - 01:39:14:09

01:39:14:09 - 01:39:14:16
it's

01:39:17:22 - 01:39:18:27
polymorphic

01:39:18:27 - 01:39:19:01

01:39:19:01 - 01:39:19:13
ever.

01:39:19:13 - 01:39:19:29
So

01:39:19:29 - 01:39:20:16
I really

01:39:20:16 - 01:39:20:25
not

01:39:20:25 - 01:39:21:28
necessarily

01:39:21:48 - 01:39:22:12
lose

01:39:22:12 - 01:39:22:31
like.

01:39:22:31 - 01:39:22:42
Like

01:39:22:42 - 01:39:23:07
what

01:39:23:07 - 01:39:23:29
is on

01:39:23:29 - 01:39:23:43
even

01:39:23:43 - 01:39:23:58
doing

01:39:23:58 - 01:39:24:27
just stand

01:39:24:27 - 01:39:24:36
there

01:39:24:36 - 01:39:25:01
the engine

01:39:25:01 - 01:39:26:06
polymorphous

01:39:26:06 - 01:39:26:58
clicks.

01:39:26:58 - 01:39:27:41
Yeah.

01:39:27:54 - 01:39:28:15
W

01:39:28:15 - 01:39:28:21
on

01:39:28:21 - 01:39:29:04
someone

01:39:29:04 - 01:39:29:46
Yeah I

01:39:29:46 - 01:39:30:12
think

01:39:31:09 - 01:39:31:22
that

01:39:31:22 - 01:39:31:57
at all

01:39:31:57 - 01:39:32:09
Let's

01:39:32:09 - 01:39:32:18
go

01:39:32:18 - 01:39:32:42
abroad.

01:39:32:42 - 01:39:32:56
Let's

01:39:32:56 - 01:39:33:10
go

01:39:33:10 - 01:39:35:22
to the

01:39:35:22 - 01:39:35:54
top.

01:39:36:06 - 01:39:38:15
Oh oh

01:39:39:10 - 01:39:39:48
and go

01:39:39:48 - 01:39:40:08
next

01:39:40:08 - 01:39:40:33
game.

01:39:40:33 - 01:39:40:53
This

01:39:40:53 - 01:39:41:29
bus.

01:39:41:29 - 01:39:41:38
No,

01:39:41:38 - 01:39:42:01
no.

01:39:42:01 - 01:39:42:27
You got

01:39:42:43 - 01:39:42:55
even

01:39:42:55 - 01:39:43:04
with

01:39:43:04 - 01:39:43:31
Baron.

01:39:43:31 - 01:39:43:42
I

01:39:43:42 - 01:39:44:00
read his

01:39:44:00 - 01:39:44:18
lips.

01:39:44:18 - 01:39:44:29
That's

01:39:44:29 - 01:39:44:36
what

01:39:44:36 - 01:39:44:40
he

01:39:44:40 - 01:39:44:56
said.

01:39:44:56 - 01:39:45:14
Oh,

01:39:45:14 - 01:39:45:32
is that

01:39:45:32 - 01:39:45:37
what

01:39:45:37 - 01:39:45:50
he said.

01:39:45:50 - 01:39:46:19
Okay.

01:39:46:40 - 01:39:47:06
Yeah.

01:39:47:37 - 01:39:47:54
All right.

01:39:47:54 - 01:39:48:10
What does

01:39:48:10 - 01:39:48:19
that

01:39:48:19 - 01:39:49:10
champion

01:39:49:10 - 01:39:49:28

01:39:49:28 - 01:39:49:51
seven

01:39:49:51 - 01:39:50:20
foot

01:39:50:48 - 01:39:51:40
something?

01:39:51:45 - 01:39:51:57
No,

01:39:51:57 - 01:39:52:03
no,

01:39:52:03 - 01:39:52:21
no.

01:39:52:21 - 01:39:52:33
The

01:39:52:33 - 01:39:52:58
Baron.

01:39:52:58 - 01:39:53:56
Yeah,

01:39:54:10 - 01:39:54:19
the

01:39:54:19 - 01:39:54:54
range.

01:39:54:54 - 01:39:55:04
That's

01:39:55:04 - 01:39:55:31
weird.

01:39:55:31 - 01:39:56:07
What?

01:39:56:13 - 01:39:56:36
It looked

01:39:56:36 - 01:39:56:50
like

01:39:56:50 - 01:39:57:16
Katherine,

01:39:57:16 - 01:39:57:32
though,

01:39:57:32 - 01:39:57:50
if

01:39:57:54 - 01:39:57:59
you

01:39:57:59 - 01:39:58:10

01:39:58:10 - 01:39:58:21

01:39:58:49 - 01:39:59:36
power,

01:39:59:36 - 01:39:59:42
you

01:39:59:42 - 01:40:00:14
see?

01:40:00:14 - 01:40:00:28
Yeah.

01:40:00:28 - 01:40:00:43
Really

01:40:00:43 - 01:40:01:01
insults.

01:40:01:01 - 01:40:01:46
Disgusting

01:40:01:46 - 01:40:01:57
is

01:40:01:57 - 01:40:02:45
a smaller

01:40:02:45 - 01:40:03:25
because

01:40:03:25 - 01:40:04:08
domestically,

01:40:04:08 - 01:40:04:37
I feel like

01:40:04:37 - 01:40:04:55
they

01:40:05:15 - 01:40:05:29
he can

01:40:05:29 - 01:40:05:54
just e

01:40:05:54 - 01:40:06:07
wait,

01:40:06:07 - 01:40:06:36
why is he going

01:40:06:36 - 01:40:06:46
to the

01:40:06:46 - 01:40:06:59
main

01:40:06:59 - 01:40:07:19
base?

01:40:07:19 - 01:40:07:35
Wait,

01:40:07:35 - 01:40:07:51
what does

01:40:07:51 - 01:40:08:22
he.

01:40:08:22 - 01:40:08:58
What?

01:40:09:41 - 01:40:10:13
Wait.

01:40:10:17 - 01:40:10:42
He needed

01:40:10:42 - 01:40:10:46
to

01:40:10:46 - 01:40:11:04
either

01:40:11:04 - 01:40:11:15
way

01:40:11:15 - 01:40:11:34
before

01:40:11:34 - 01:40:11:51
it hit

01:40:11:51 - 01:40:12:16
the turret.

01:40:12:16 - 01:40:12:46
What

01:40:12:46 - 01:40:13:30
the meal

01:40:13:42 - 01:40:13:53
was

01:40:13:53 - 01:40:14:18

01:40:14:27 - 01:40:14:56

01:40:15:07 - 01:40:15:30

01:40:15:30 - 01:40:15:34
it,

01:40:17:20 - 01:40:17:38

01:40:17:38 - 01:40:17:52
it by

01:40:17:52 - 01:40:18:00
the

01:40:18:00 - 01:40:18:12
book.

01:40:18:12 - 01:40:18:21
They

01:40:18:21 - 01:40:18:36
look it

01:40:18:36 - 01:40:18:45
But

01:40:18:45 - 01:40:19:06
I've been

01:40:19:06 - 01:40:19:42
thinking

01:40:20:02 - 01:40:20:26
elected

01:40:20:26 - 01:40:21:16
information.

01:40:21:16 - 01:40:21:32
What's

01:40:21:32 - 01:40:21:54
happening?

01:40:21:54 - 01:40:22:22
Yeah,

01:40:22:24 - 01:40:22:41
people

01:40:22:41 - 01:40:23:06
laugh.

01:40:23:06 - 01:40:23:45
Yeah,

01:40:24:30 - 01:40:25:10
I can tell

01:40:25:10 - 01:40:25:26
it

01:40:25:26 - 01:40:25:33
was

01:40:25:33 - 01:40:25:44
not

01:40:25:44 - 01:40:25:57
his

01:40:25:57 - 01:40:26:22
decision.

01:40:26:22 - 01:40:26:40
It was

01:40:26:40 - 01:40:27:07
junglers.

01:40:27:07 - 01:40:27:12
Who

01:40:27:12 - 01:40:27:28
called?

01:40:27:28 - 01:40:27:50
It's

01:40:27:52 - 01:40:28:23
okay.

01:40:28:23 - 01:40:28:30
In

01:40:28:37 - 01:40:28:53
just a

01:40:28:53 - 01:40:29:18
few

01:40:29:18 - 01:40:29:49
seconds.

01:40:29:49 - 01:40:30:02
Oh,

01:40:30:02 - 01:40:30:45
elbow.

01:40:30:45 - 01:40:31:12
He'll

01:40:31:21 - 01:40:31:46
continue

01:40:31:46 - 01:40:32:02
to put

01:40:32:02 - 01:40:32:15
all

01:40:32:15 - 01:40:32:25
this

01:40:32:25 - 01:40:32:45
pressure

01:40:32:45 - 01:40:33:10
on the top.

01:40:33:10 - 01:40:33:21
Oh,

01:40:33:21 - 01:40:33:45
you found

01:40:33:45 - 01:40:33:55
him.

01:40:33:55 - 01:40:34:04
Oh,

thank you

01:40:34:19 - 01:40:34:24

01:40:36:28 - 01:40:37:01
Yeah,

01:40:37:01 - 01:40:37:06
you're

01:40:37:06 - 01:40:37:13
going

01:40:37:13 - 01:40:37:17
to

01:40:37:17 - 01:40:37:28
worry

01:40:37:28 - 01:40:37:35
about

01:40:37:35 - 01:40:37:44
that

01:40:37:44 - 01:40:37:58
one.

01:40:38:09 - 01:40:38:36
I think

01:40:38:36 - 01:40:38:43
there

01:40:38:43 - 01:40:38:52
was

01:40:38:52 - 01:40:39:07
even

01:40:39:07 - 01:40:39:12
an

01:40:39:12 - 01:40:40:13
interview.

01:40:40:25 - 01:40:40:42
Oh,

talking

01:40:44:18 - 01:40:44:34
about

01:40:44:34 - 01:40:44:49
him.

01:40:45:48 - 01:40:45:54
I'll

01:40:45:54 - 01:40:46:44
think about the.

01:40:46:44 - 01:40:46:57
Why.

01:40:46:57 - 01:40:47:27
Why are they

01:40:47:27 - 01:40:47:51

01:40:52:03 - 01:40:53:27
Why is he

01:41:07:48 - 01:41:08:04
dive

01:41:08:04 - 01:41:08:15
with

01:41:08:15 - 01:41:08:54
I don't know

01:41:08:54 - 01:41:09:06
if you

01:41:09:06 - 01:41:09:15
got

01:41:09:15 - 01:41:09:41
stop.

01:41:09:46 - 01:41:10:01
Oh,

01:41:10:13 - 01:41:10:30
wait.

01:41:10:30 - 01:41:10:57
Oh,

01:41:10:57 - 01:41:11:09
let's

01:41:11:09 - 01:41:11:29
watch

01:41:11:29 - 01:41:12:30

01:41:12:30 - 01:41:12:55
He did it

01:41:12:55 - 01:41:13:03
but

01:41:13:03 - 01:41:13:21
I still

01:41:13:21 - 01:41:13:35
had

01:41:13:35 - 01:41:14:11
enough.

01:41:14:16 - 01:41:14:34
This.

01:41:14:34 - 01:41:15:14
Yeah,

01:41:15:32 - 01:41:15:52
they had

01:41:15:52 - 01:41:16:19
enough,

01:41:16:19 - 01:41:16:31
but.

01:41:16:31 - 01:41:17:04
But

01:41:17:24 - 01:41:18:07
Twitter

01:41:18:18 - 01:41:18:32

Oh, my

01:41:38:07 - 01:41:38:13
be.

01:41:38:13 - 01:41:38:18
You're

01:41:38:18 - 01:41:38:29
not

01:41:38:29 - 01:41:38:54
so bad

01:41:38:54 - 01:41:39:30

01:41:39:43 - 01:41:39:55
It's

01:41:39:55 - 01:41:40:13

01:41:41:25 - 01:41:41:53
you know.

01:41:41:53 - 01:41:42:45
So

01:41:42:45 - 01:41:42:57

01:41:42:57 - 01:41:43:04
want

01:41:43:04 - 01:41:43:08

01:41:43:19 - 01:41:43:26
you

01:41:43:26 - 01:41:43:37

01:41:43:37 - 01:41:43:42
you

01:41:43:42 - 01:41:44:04
know?

01:41:44:17 - 01:41:44:47
Incredible.

01:41:44:47 - 01:41:45:07
Thought

01:41:45:07 - 01:41:45:27
about

01:41:45:27 - 01:41:45:37
it.

01:41:45:49 - 01:41:46:15
All right,

01:41:46:24 - 01:41:46:28
I'll

01:41:46:28 - 01:41:46:35

01:41:46:35 - 01:41:47:04
expected.

01:41:47:04 - 01:41:47:54
Okay.

01:41:47:54 - 01:41:48:14
I'm

01:41:48:14 - 01:41:48:25

01:41:49:53 - 01:41:50:09
beer.

01:41:50:09 - 01:41:50:31
Okay?

01:41:50:31 - 01:41:50:40
Because

01:41:50:40 - 01:41:50:43
they

01:41:50:43 - 01:41:50:56
didn't

01:41:50:56 - 01:41:51:10
last

01:41:51:10 - 01:41:51:37
time.

01:41:51:37 - 01:41:51:50
Yeah,

01:41:51:50 - 01:41:52:04

01:41:52:04 - 01:41:52:12

Golden

01:41:55:55 - 01:41:56:42
audience.

01:41:56:49 - 01:41:57:10
Actually,

01:41:57:10 - 01:41:57:23
let's

01:41:57:23 - 01:41:57:34
draw

01:41:57:34 - 01:41:57:46
one

01:41:57:46 - 01:41:58:30
sketch

01:41:58:30 - 01:41:58:48

01:41:58:48 - 01:41:59:09

01:41:59:09 - 01:41:59:49
Okay.

01:42:03:45 - 01:42:03:57
go

01:42:03:57 - 01:42:04:35
onto.

01:42:04:35 - 01:42:05:17

Yeah,

I just

01:42:10:40 - 01:42:11:00
closed

01:42:11:00 - 01:42:11:18
it.

01:42:11:31 - 01:42:11:45
Oh,

01:42:11:45 - 01:42:12:03
okay.

01:42:12:03 - 01:42:12:16

01:42:12:25 - 01:42:12:37

Okay.

It's

01:42:23:04 - 01:42:23:07

look

01:42:23:43 - 01:42:23:56
for

01:42:23:56 - 01:42:24:00
it.

01:42:24:00 - 01:42:24:50
That was not

01:42:24:50 - 01:42:24:55
the

01:42:24:55 - 01:42:25:35
peak.

01:42:25:35 - 01:42:26:00
Performance

01:42:26:00 - 01:42:26:07
is

01:42:26:07 - 01:42:26:20
a has

01:42:26:20 - 01:42:26:29
to be

01:42:26:29 - 01:42:26:45
said,

01:42:26:45 - 01:42:27:07
but

01:42:28:39 - 01:42:28:42
you

01:42:28:42 - 01:42:28:55

01:42:28:58 - 01:42:29:29
work

01:42:29:29 - 01:42:29:57

01:42:29:57 - 01:42:30:17
great

01:42:30:34 - 01:42:32:42
this late.

01:42:32:42 - 01:42:32:58
But

01:42:32:58 - 01:42:33:16
they are

01:42:33:16 - 01:42:33:23
the

01:42:33:23 - 01:42:34:12
game.

01:42:34:12 - 01:42:34:20
I'm

01:42:34:21 - 01:42:34:35
saying it

01:42:34:35 - 01:42:34:39

01:42:34:39 - 01:42:34:53
next

01:42:34:53 - 01:42:35:11
12

01:42:35:11 - 01:42:35:29
are in

01:42:35:29 - 01:42:35:43
the

01:42:35:43 - 01:42:36:07

01:42:36:07 - 01:42:36:27
Bracket

01:42:36:27 - 01:42:36:43
zone

01:42:36:43 - 01:42:36:57
is

01:42:38:40 - 01:42:38:47
they

01:42:38:47 - 01:42:39:03
sound

01:42:39:03 - 01:42:39:25
like

01:42:39:25 - 01:42:39:43
him.

01:42:39:43 - 01:42:40:12
Yeah

01:42:41:28 - 01:42:42:34
All right

01:42:42:34 - 01:42:42:41

I think

01:42:46:51 - 01:42:47:24

even

01:42:48:05 - 01:42:48:23

01:42:50:07 - 01:42:50:25
on them

01:42:50:25 - 01:42:51:03
again.

01:42:51:03 - 01:42:51:31
I try

01:42:51:31 - 01:42:51:36

01:42:57:19 - 01:42:57:25
see,

01:42:57:25 - 01:42:57:36
the

01:42:57:45 - 01:42:58:04
severe

01:42:58:04 - 01:42:58:28
splash.

01:42:58:28 - 01:42:58:40
It's

01:42:58:40 - 01:42:59:36
changed

01:42:59:36 - 01:42:59:45
all

01:42:59:45 - 01:43:00:07
before,

01:43:00:07 - 01:43:00:59
but I

01:43:00:59 - 01:43:01:06
do

01:43:02:07 - 01:43:02:34
not

01:43:02:34 - 01:43:02:43
know.

01:43:02:43 - 01:43:04:15
But I

01:43:04:15 - 01:43:04:26
think,

01:43:04:26 - 01:43:05:56
Oh, we

01:43:05:56 - 01:43:06:37
will.

01:43:06:37 - 01:43:06:43
And

01:43:06:43 - 01:43:06:52
like

01:43:06:52 - 01:43:06:55
you

01:43:06:55 - 01:43:08:09
say LA

01:43:08:09 - 01:43:08:27
we

01:43:08:27 - 01:43:08:58
will.

01:43:08:58 - 01:43:09:07
But

01:43:09:07 - 01:43:09:21
it felt

01:43:09:21 - 01:43:09:39
like

01:43:10:04 - 01:43:10:13
we're

01:43:10:13 - 01:43:10:28
waiting

01:43:10:28 - 01:43:10:46
for.

01:43:10:46 - 01:43:10:53
We're

01:43:10:53 - 01:43:11:04
waiting

01:43:11:04 - 01:43:11:09
for

01:43:11:09 - 01:43:11:27
selfie.

01:43:11:27 - 01:43:11:36
Wait,

01:43:11:36 - 01:43:11:47
let me

01:43:11:47 - 01:43:11:58
get my

01:43:11:58 - 01:43:12:14
coffee

01:43:12:14 - 01:43:12:49
project.

01:43:14:36 - 01:43:14:58
Hey,

01:43:14:58 - 01:43:15:10
hey.

01:43:15:10 - 01:43:15:21
Well,

01:43:15:21 - 01:43:15:30
we're

01:43:15:30 - 01:43:15:37
going

01:43:15:37 - 01:43:15:46
to

01:43:15:46 - 01:43:16:08
just

01:43:16:17 - 01:43:16:40
wait.

01:43:16:40 - 01:43:16:53
Does

01:43:16:53 - 01:43:17:02
she

01:43:17:02 - 01:43:17:13
look

01:43:17:13 - 01:43:17:31
different

01:43:17:31 - 01:43:17:36
in

01:43:17:36 - 01:43:17:47
game

01:43:17:47 - 01:43:17:54
as

01:43:17:54 - 01:43:18:30
well?

01:43:18:45 - 01:43:18:57
Just

01:43:18:57 - 01:43:19:13
go for

01:43:19:13 - 01:43:19:25
that.

01:43:19:26 - 01:43:19:42
I

01:43:19:42 - 01:43:20:09
don't think

01:43:20:09 - 01:43:20:15
so.

01:43:20:15 - 01:43:20:33
I think

01:43:20:33 - 01:43:20:49
it was

01:43:20:49 - 01:43:21:16
just

01:43:21:16 - 01:43:21:34
last

01:43:21:34 - 01:43:21:46
night

01:43:21:46 - 01:43:21:55
up

01:43:21:55 - 01:43:22:15
there

01:43:22:28 - 01:43:22:33
have

01:43:22:33 - 01:43:23:07
been.

01:43:23:09 - 01:43:23:25
That's

01:43:23:25 - 01:43:23:40
my

01:43:23:40 - 01:43:23:59
guess.

01:43:23:59 - 01:43:24:00
It's.

01:43:25:08 - 01:43:25:20
I

01:43:25:33 - 01:43:25:48
faint.

01:43:25:48 - 01:43:25:55
They

01:43:25:55 - 01:43:26:38
changed

01:43:26:38 - 01:43:27:14
her

01:43:27:14 - 01:43:27:36
look

01:43:27:36 - 01:43:27:55
already

01:43:27:55 - 01:43:28:39
some time

01:43:28:39 - 01:43:28:48
and

01:43:28:48 - 01:43:29:19
not

01:43:29:24 - 01:43:29:37
I

01:43:29:37 - 01:43:30:10
actually

01:43:30:10 - 01:43:30:21
the

01:43:30:21 - 01:43:30:37
quad

01:43:30:37 - 01:43:30:59
two years

01:43:30:59 - 01:43:31:13
ago

01:43:31:13 - 01:43:31:21
for

01:43:31:21 - 01:43:31:57
sure

01:43:32:00 - 01:43:32:11
but

01:43:32:11 - 01:43:32:29
she

01:43:32:29 - 01:43:32:43
she

01:43:32:43 - 01:43:33:24
Yeah

01:43:33:46 - 01:43:34:01
but

01:43:34:01 - 01:43:34:20
first

01:43:34:20 - 01:43:35:27
letters

01:43:35:56 - 01:43:36:05
it

01:43:36:05 - 01:43:36:19
shows

01:43:36:19 - 01:43:36:27
that

01:43:36:27 - 01:43:36:34
she

01:43:36:34 - 01:43:36:39
has

01:43:36:39 - 01:43:37:03
something

01:43:37:03 - 01:43:37:21
on her

01:43:37:21 - 01:43:37:44
head

01:43:37:44 - 01:43:38:07
that's

01:43:38:07 - 01:43:38:25
all

01:43:38:25 - 01:43:38:34
she

01:43:38:34 - 01:43:38:49
always

01:43:38:49 - 01:43:39:05
says.

01:43:39:05 - 01:43:39:12
I'm

01:43:39:12 - 01:43:39:30
going

01:43:39:30 - 01:43:40:03
to

01:43:40:04 - 01:43:40:26
stay

01:43:40:26 - 01:43:41:02
there

01:43:41:06 - 01:43:41:12
and

01:43:41:31 - 01:43:42:07
plus

01:43:42:07 - 01:43:42:16
I'm

01:43:42:16 - 01:43:42:25
going

01:43:42:25 - 01:43:42:30
to

01:43:42:30 - 01:43:42:48

01:43:42:48 - 01:43:43:04
that

01:43:43:13 - 01:43:43:28
all

01:43:43:28 - 01:43:43:44
this

01:43:43:44 - 01:43:44:09
one.

01:43:44:47 - 01:43:44:55
Oh,

01:43:44:55 - 01:43:45:03
it's

01:43:45:03 - 01:43:45:21
kinda

01:43:45:21 - 01:43:45:37
cool.

01:43:45:37 - 01:43:46:06
But

01:43:46:08 - 01:43:46:21
don't

01:43:46:21 - 01:43:46:28
you

01:43:46:28 - 01:43:46:40
think

01:43:46:40 - 01:43:46:46
it

01:43:46:46 - 01:43:46:58
looks

01:43:46:58 - 01:43:47:11
more

01:43:47:11 - 01:43:47:34
like a

01:43:47:34 - 01:43:47:56
routine?

01:43:47:56 - 01:43:48:21
There are

01:43:48:21 - 01:43:48:39
kind

01:43:48:39 - 01:43:48:54
of

01:43:49:03 - 01:43:49:37
pluses.

01:43:49:37 - 01:43:49:42
I

01:43:49:42 - 01:43:49:51
don't

01:43:49:51 - 01:43:50:03
feel

01:43:50:03 - 01:43:50:29
like.

01:43:50:29 - 01:43:50:52
Like,

01:43:50:52 - 01:43:51:23
like,

01:43:51:23 - 01:43:51:37
because

01:43:51:37 - 01:43:51:55
I don't know

01:43:51:55 - 01:43:52:06
if you

01:43:52:06 - 01:43:52:16
saw a

01:43:52:16 - 01:43:52:46
therapist

01:43:52:46 - 01:43:52:53
there

01:43:52:53 - 01:43:53:06
at the

01:43:53:06 - 01:43:53:52
Plaza

01:43:54:21 - 01:43:54:43
join

01:43:54:43 - 01:43:55:12
the kind

01:43:55:12 - 01:43:55:30
of.

01:43:55:44 - 01:43:55:53
It

01:43:55:53 - 01:43:56:06
does

01:43:56:06 - 01:43:56:16
look

01:43:56:16 - 01:43:56:27
kind

01:43:56:27 - 01:43:56:34
of

01:43:56:34 - 01:43:56:47
feel

01:43:56:47 - 01:43:57:33
better.

01:43:57:46 - 01:43:57:57
It's

01:43:57:57 - 01:43:58:12
kind

01:43:58:12 - 01:43:58:19
of

01:43:58:19 - 01:43:58:35
this

01:43:58:35 - 01:43:58:49
kind

01:43:58:49 - 01:43:59:13
of thing.

01:43:59:13 - 01:43:59:25
But

01:43:59:25 - 01:43:59:36
this

01:43:59:36 - 01:43:59:58
to me

01:43:59:58 - 01:44:00:03
is

01:44:00:03 - 01:44:00:36
like

01:44:00:37 - 01:44:01:17
nothing

01:44:01:21 - 01:44:02:16
out of

01:44:02:16 - 01:44:04:21
the array.

01:44:04:21 - 01:44:04:46
You knew

01:44:04:46 - 01:44:04:51
it.

01:44:04:51 - 01:44:05:06
Spell

01:44:05:06 - 01:44:05:13
it

01:44:05:13 - 01:44:05:42
right.

01:44:06:03 - 01:44:06:16
Right.

01:44:06:16 - 01:44:06:23
Did

01:44:06:23 - 01:44:06:34
you?

01:44:07:53 - 01:44:08:07
I

01:44:08:07 - 01:44:08:18
don't

01:44:08:18 - 01:44:08:34
think

01:44:08:34 - 01:44:08:42
you.

01:44:09:07 - 01:44:09:23
No,

01:44:09:23 - 01:44:09:27
you

01:44:09:27 - 01:44:09:41
didn't.

01:44:09:41 - 01:44:09:48
You

01:44:09:48 - 01:44:10:04
didn't.

01:44:10:04 - 01:44:10:35
Okay.

01:44:10:35 - 01:44:11:11
I think

01:44:11:11 - 01:44:11:40
it's

01:44:11:47 - 01:44:12:59
Aurelio.

01:44:12:59 - 01:44:13:35
Oh,

01:44:13:35 - 01:44:13:49
there's

01:44:13:49 - 01:44:14:18
an O

01:44:14:18 - 01:44:14:31
instead

01:44:14:31 - 01:44:14:42
of an

01:44:14:42 - 01:44:15:03
I.

01:44:15:16 - 01:44:15:27
I

01:44:15:27 - 01:44:15:37
didn't

01:44:15:37 - 01:44:15:46
know

01:44:15:46 - 01:44:15:57
that

01:44:15:57 - 01:44:16:51
I was

01:44:16:51 - 01:44:17:06
writing

01:44:17:06 - 01:44:17:15
this

01:44:17:15 - 01:44:17:31
when

01:44:17:31 - 01:44:17:52
I read

01:44:17:52 - 01:44:18:07
it,

01:44:18:36 - 01:44:18:55
I always

01:44:18:55 - 01:44:19:17
go

01:44:19:17 - 01:44:20:01
look,

01:44:20:01 - 01:44:20:37

01:44:21:07 - 01:44:21:12
to

01:44:21:12 - 01:44:21:59
start.

01:44:21:59 - 01:44:22:13
All right,

01:44:22:13 - 01:44:22:24

01:44:22:24 - 01:44:22:31
go.

01:44:22:48 - 01:44:22:58
I'm

01:44:22:58 - 01:44:23:13
drawing

01:44:23:13 - 01:44:23:42
first.

01:44:23:42 - 01:44:24:27
All right.

01:44:24:27 - 01:44:24:57
Oh,

01:44:24:57 - 01:44:25:30
the

01:44:25:31 - 01:44:25:51
wait.

01:44:25:51 - 01:44:26:09
What?

01:44:26:09 - 01:44:26:24
It's a

01:44:26:24 - 01:44:27:52
skin.

01:44:27:52 - 01:44:28:09
Hey,

01:44:28:09 - 01:44:29:02
yo,

01:44:29:02 - 01:44:29:25
Jenn.

01:44:29:25 - 01:44:29:43
Oh,

01:44:29:43 - 01:44:30:23
hell,

01:44:30:23 - 01:44:31:03
no.

01:44:31:08 - 01:44:31:39
Oh,

01:44:31:39 - 01:44:31:46
no,

01:44:31:46 - 01:44:32:16
no,

01:44:32:16 - 01:44:32:42
wait.

01:44:32:52 - 01:44:33:25
But

01:44:33:34 - 01:44:33:59
check.

01:44:34:04 - 01:44:34:24
Okay,

01:44:34:24 - 01:44:34:49
Here.

01:44:34:49 - 01:44:35:16
I changed.

01:44:35:16 - 01:44:35:31
I changed

01:44:35:31 - 01:44:35:36
it.

01:44:35:36 - 01:44:35:51
Okay,

01:44:35:51 - 01:44:36:16
okay,

01:44:36:48 - 01:44:37:28
okay.

01:44:38:06 - 01:44:38:13
Here

01:44:38:13 - 01:44:38:43
we go.

01:44:38:43 - 01:44:39:55
Mm.

01:44:40:19 - 01:44:40:48
Uh,

01:44:41:03 - 01:44:41:36
off.

01:44:42:09 - 01:44:43:12
I feel

Oh,

01:53:30:36 - 01:53:30:45

Yeah.

01:53:31:46 - 01:53:32:00
Oh,

Very,

01:57:44:56 - 01:57:45:09
very

01:57:45:09 - 01:57:45:59

01:57:46:48 - 01:57:47:30
Oh, my

01:57:47:30 - 01:57:48:51
Lord.

01:57:50:06 - 01:57:50:27
Oh,

01:57:50:27 - 01:57:51:05

01:57:51:05 - 01:57:51:36
Well,

01:57:51:36 - 01:57:51:45
my

01:57:51:45 - 01:57:51:55
food

01:57:51:55 - 01:57:52:03

01:57:52:03 - 01:57:52:19
got here

01:57:52:19 - 01:57:52:39
to one

01:57:52:39 - 01:57:52:55
second,

01:57:52:55 - 01:57:53:04
One

01:57:53:04 - 01:57:53:27
second.

01:57:53:27 - 01:57:54:01
Predictable.

01:57:54:01 - 01:57:54:07
And

01:57:54:07 - 01:57:54:19
he's

01:57:54:19 - 01:57:54:32
on the

01:57:54:32 - 01:57:54:55
carries.

01:57:54:55 - 01:57:55:06
That's

01:57:55:06 - 01:57:55:12
why

01:57:55:12 - 01:57:55:19
he's

01:57:55:19 - 01:57:55:26
good.

01:57:55:26 - 01:57:56:06
Participation

01:57:56:06 - 01:57:56:40
is lower

01:57:56:40 - 01:57:56:49
because

01:57:56:49 - 01:57:56:52
he

01:57:56:52 - 01:57:57:12
plays

01:57:57:12 - 01:57:57:14
a

01:57:57:14 - 01:57:57:23
little

01:57:57:23 - 01:57:57:32

01:57:57:32 - 01:57:58:26
himself.

01:57:59:00 - 01:57:59:07
And

01:57:59:07 - 01:57:59:16
we'll

01:57:59:16 - 01:57:59:25
see

01:57:59:25 - 01:57:59:34
what

01:57:59:34 - 01:58:00:01

here

01:58:10:46 - 01:58:11:09
we have

01:58:11:09 - 01:58:13:31
35% of the fans

01:58:13:35 - 01:58:13:58
thinking

01:58:13:58 - 01:58:14:07
that

01:58:14:07 - 01:58:14:42
guy is

01:58:14:42 - 01:58:14:49

01:58:17:43 - 01:58:18:09
What do you think

01:58:18:09 - 01:58:18:18
about

01:58:18:18 - 01:58:18:28
those

01:58:18:28 - 01:58:19:01
numbers?

01:58:19:45 - 01:58:20:08
Think

01:58:20:28 - 01:58:20:52
if I were

01:58:20:52 - 01:58:21:01
out

01:58:21:01 - 01:58:21:21
to say

01:58:21:21 - 01:58:21:28
I

01:58:21:28 - 01:58:21:45
might be

01:58:21:45 - 01:58:21:46
a

01:58:21:46 - 01:58:21:59
little

01:58:21:59 - 01:58:22:34
biased.

01:58:22:34 - 01:58:22:57
Go on.

01:58:22:57 - 01:58:23:11
Those

01:58:23:11 - 01:58:23:38
go on.

01:58:23:38 - 01:58:23:52
Yeah.

01:58:23:52 - 01:58:24:07
I'm

01:58:24:07 - 01:58:24:21
glad

01:58:24:21 - 01:58:24:27
that

01:58:24:27 - 01:58:24:34
we're

01:58:24:34 - 01:58:24:45
still

01:58:24:45 - 01:58:24:48
the

01:58:24:48 - 01:58:25:12
majority.

01:58:25:12 - 01:58:25:24
How about

01:58:25:24 - 01:58:25:39
that?

01:58:25:39 - 01:58:25:55
Yeah.

01:58:25:55 - 01:58:26:15
Okay.

01:58:26:15 - 01:58:26:25
Fair

01:58:26:25 - 01:58:26:38
enough.

01:58:26:38 - 01:58:26:47
Should

01:58:26:47 - 01:58:26:52
have

01:58:26:52 - 01:58:27:10
been,

01:58:27:39 - 01:58:28:10
I

01:58:28:10 - 01:58:28:31
think.

01:58:28:31 - 01:58:29:07
All right,

01:58:29:20 - 01:58:29:31
let me

01:58:29:31 - 01:58:29:52
just

01:58:29:56 - 01:58:30:05
eat

01:58:30:05 - 01:58:30:21
my food

01:58:30:21 - 01:58:30:34
really

01:58:30:34 - 01:58:30:45
quick.

01:58:30:45 - 01:58:30:51
We're

01:58:30:51 - 01:58:30:59
just

01:58:30:59 - 01:58:31:07
gonna

01:58:31:07 - 01:58:31:21
listen

01:58:31:21 - 01:58:31:30
to the

01:58:31:30 - 01:58:32:07
stream,

01:58:32:07 - 01:58:33:01
the fans,

01:58:33:10 - 01:58:33:16
and

01:58:33:16 - 01:58:33:23
then

01:58:33:23 - 01:58:34:17
obviously

01:58:34:17 - 01:58:34:40
selfish

01:58:34:40 - 01:58:35:06
and

01:58:35:06 - 01:58:35:31
familiar.

01:58:35:31 - 01:58:35:58
Like

01:58:35:58 - 01:58:36:03
for

01:58:36:03 - 01:58:36:46
the game,

01:58:36:48 - 01:58:37:21
I don't know

01:58:37:21 - 01:58:37:30
if you

01:58:37:30 - 01:58:37:37
want

01:58:37:37 - 01:58:37:40
to

01:58:37:40 - 01:58:38:11
chat,

01:58:38:11 - 01:58:38:25
but,

01:58:38:25 - 01:58:38:33
you

01:58:38:33 - 01:58:38:54
know,

01:58:39:10 - 01:58:40:03
prediction.

01:58:40:03 - 01:58:40:23
Yeah.

01:58:40:23 - 01:58:40:35
This

01:58:40:35 - 01:58:40:46
time

01:58:40:46 - 01:58:40:51
to

01:58:40:51 - 01:58:41:06
show it

01:58:41:06 - 01:58:41:27
again.

01:58:41:27 - 01:58:41:56
Yeah.

01:58:41:56 - 01:58:42:05
It's

01:58:42:05 - 01:58:42:19
like I

01:58:42:19 - 01:58:42:28
didn't

01:58:42:28 - 01:58:42:42
know

01:58:42:52 - 01:58:43:04
we were

01:58:43:04 - 01:58:43:17
bringing

01:58:43:17 - 01:58:43:24
this

01:58:43:24 - 01:58:43:39
back,

01:58:43:39 - 01:58:43:44
but

01:58:43:44 - 01:58:44:13
yeah,

01:58:44:13 - 01:58:44:27
that

01:58:44:27 - 01:58:44:34
is

01:58:44:34 - 01:58:44:52
the,

01:58:44:52 - 01:58:45:00
the

01:58:45:00 - 01:58:45:25
answer

01:58:45:25 - 01:58:45:36
for

01:58:45:36 - 01:58:45:48
any

01:58:46:48 - 01:58:47:06
fans,

01:58:47:06 - 01:58:47:11
the

01:58:47:11 - 01:58:47:24
people

01:58:47:24 - 01:58:47:29
who

01:58:47:29 - 01:58:47:34
are

01:58:47:34 - 01:58:47:45
not

01:58:47:45 - 01:58:48:03
believing

01:58:48:03 - 01:58:48:16
in them

01:58:48:16 - 01:58:49:03
currently.

01:58:49:03 - 01:58:49:19
I mean

01:58:49:19 - 01:58:49:30
that's

01:58:49:30 - 01:58:49:55
interesting

01:58:49:55 - 01:58:50:00
when

01:58:50:00 - 01:58:50:07
you

01:58:50:07 - 01:58:50:20
think

01:58:50:20 - 01:58:50:27
of

01:58:50:27 - 01:58:50:36
this

01:58:50:36 - 01:58:51:12
matchup,

01:58:51:14 - 01:58:51:28
as we

01:58:51:28 - 01:58:51:41
said,

01:58:51:41 - 01:58:52:01
Golden

01:58:52:01 - 01:58:52:40
Guardians

01:58:52:40 - 01:58:52:58
didn't

01:58:52:58 - 01:58:53:13
have

01:58:53:13 - 01:58:53:18
the

01:58:53:18 - 01:58:53:34
best

01:58:53:34 - 01:58:53:54
run at

01:58:53:54 - 01:58:54:01
the

01:58:54:01 - 01:58:54:50
beginning

01:58:54:50 - 01:58:55:06
of

01:58:55:06 - 01:58:56:06
the split.

01:58:56:06 - 01:58:56:20
They

01:58:56:20 - 01:58:56:42
earned

01:58:56:42 - 01:58:57:03
their

01:58:57:16 - 01:58:57:28
at

01:58:57:28 - 01:58:58:04
MSI.

01:58:58:04 - 01:58:58:15
And

01:58:58:15 - 01:58:58:40
I think

01:58:58:40 - 01:58:59:06
it's

01:58:59:09 - 01:58:59:27
down

01:58:59:27 - 01:59:00:05
to

01:59:00:05 - 01:59:01:06
maybe

01:59:01:08 - 01:59:01:15
the

01:59:01:15 - 01:59:01:28
few

01:59:01:28 - 01:59:02:24
individualities

01:59:02:24 - 01:59:02:36
of

01:59:02:36 - 01:59:03:03
the team

01:59:03:03 - 01:59:03:32
shining

01:59:03:32 - 01:59:03:37
at

01:59:03:37 - 01:59:04:03
different

01:59:04:03 - 01:59:04:28
moments.

01:59:04:28 - 01:59:04:39
But

01:59:04:39 - 01:59:05:07
who would you

01:59:05:07 - 01:59:06:05
highlights

01:59:06:05 - 01:59:07:03
as the

01:59:07:03 - 01:59:07:33
backbone

01:59:07:33 - 01:59:07:44
of the

01:59:07:44 - 01:59:08:06
team?

01:59:08:06 - 01:59:09:00
The

01:59:09:14 - 01:59:09:39
main

01:59:09:39 - 01:59:09:56
player.
